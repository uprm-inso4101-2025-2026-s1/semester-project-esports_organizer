=== 3.2 Validation and Verification

Validation determines whether stakeholders agree with our understanding of the esports domain as we have documented it.

**Domain Concept Validation:**

Present our identified concepts to stakeholders and ask for their agreement:

- Present our concept of *Gaming Community* as "groups of players who compete in specific games within geographic regions" to community members and verify this reflects their experience
- Share our understanding of *Local Competitive Scene* as "geographically-bounded communities where players can feasibly attend in-person events" with tournament organizers and participants

**Domain Understanding Validation:**

Present our domain analysis directly to stakeholders:

- Share our understanding that tournaments contain structured match progressions organized in brackets, and verify this reflects how competitive events actually operate
- Show our understanding that competition results and player rankings currently exist in fragmented form across different platforms, and ask stakeholders if this characterizes their current situation

**Terminology Validation:**

Present our terminology definitions to stakeholders and ask for confirmation:

- Confirm that our definition of *Match* as individual competitions within tournaments aligns with how stakeholders use this term
- Check that our concept boundaries between different domain entities match stakeholder understanding

==== Verification Strategy

[.hl-red]#All concepts in the domain are used consistently across documentation, requirements, and architecture. Requirements clearly trace back to domain properties, and every property that affects the system generates the right requirements. The software architecture covers all specified requirements without gaps, with components having clear responsibilities. The data model represents all domain concepts without conflicts. Implementation matches the design, with unit tests covering all components and interfaces working as specified. Finally, every requirement has a matching test case, and testing environments reflect the operational conditions defined.#

[.hl-green]#*Conceptual Consistency:* All concepts in the domain are used consistently across documentation, requirements, and architecture. Requirements clearly trace back to domain properties, and every property that affects the system generates the right requirements.#

[.hl-green]#*Architectural Completeness:* The software architecture covers all specified requirements without gaps, with components having clear responsibilities. The data model represents all domain concepts without conflicts.#

[.hl-green]#*Implementation Alignment:* Implementation matches the design, with comprehensive test coverage ensuring correctness.#

[.hl-green]#Every requirement has a matching test case using the following test types:#

[.hl-green]#*Unit Tests:* Cover individual component logic, domain model behavior, and business rule validation. These tests verify that individual classes and methods function correctly in isolation.#

[.hl-green]#*Integration Tests:* Verify interactions between system components, database operations, and service layer functionality. These tests ensure that the Database Wrapper correctly manages Users, Teams, and Events entities.#

[.hl-green]#*API Tests:* Validate interface contracts, request/response formats, and endpoint behavior. These tests confirm that external interfaces adhere to specifications and handle edge cases appropriately.#

[.hl-green]#*End-to-End Tests:* Confirm complete user workflows from tournament creation through result tracking. These tests simulate real user scenarios, such as creating an account, joining a team, registering for an event, and viewing rankings.#

[.hl-green]#*Acceptance Tests:* Verify that implemented features meet stakeholder requirements as defined in user stories. These tests ensure that the system delivers the value promised to competitive gaming communities.#

[.hl-green]#Testing environments reflect the operational conditions defined in requirements, with test data representing realistic competitive gaming scenarios.#

==== Success Criteria

*Validation Success Indicators:*

- Stakeholders recognize their experiences in our domain scenarios and confirm our understanding is accurate
- Stakeholders agree with our concept definitions and the relationships we've identified between domain entities
- When stakeholders suggest modifications, they represent refinements rather than fundamental misunderstandings of the domain

*Verification Success Indicators:*

- All cross-references between project documents are accurate and consistent
- Domain concepts are used consistently across all development phases
- Requirements properly trace to domain properties without gaps or contradictions
- Software architecture adequately addresses all specified requirements without conflicts
- [.hl-green]#Each requirement maps to at least one test case of the appropriate type(s)#
