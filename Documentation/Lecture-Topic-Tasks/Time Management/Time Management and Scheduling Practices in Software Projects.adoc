= Time Management and Scheduling Practices in Software Projects

== Introduction
This documentation section is based on *Slides 1–86* of the lecture **"Time Management – Scheduling and Planning"** by Prof. Marko Schütz-Schmuck (University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez, March 21, 2022).  
The lecture emphasizes the importance of systematic time tracking, estimation accuracy, and sustainable scheduling in software engineering projects.  
Proper documentation of time and planning data not only improves individual efficiency but also supports reliable team coordination under Agile methodologies.

== 1. Management and Planning Fundamentals (Slides 1–14)
Time management begins with *data tracking*.  
Engineers are encouraged to maintain personal time logs documenting all work activities, interruptions, and outcomes.  
This tracking process enables:
* More accurate future time estimates.  
* Identification of recurring inefficiencies.  
* Improved accountability within the project documentation.  

Consistent record-keeping allows developers to transform time data into evidence for planning adjustments and progress evaluation.

== 2. Personal Software Process (PSP) (Slides 15–33)
The **Personal Software Process (PSP)** is a structured approach to self-management through measurement.  
It relies on personally collected data to improve an engineer’s performance and the quality of their work.  
By recording *actual vs. estimated* times, PSP encourages reflection and process improvement.  
In documentation:
* PSP logs can justify realistic task deadlines.  
* Each major task or document section should include estimated vs. actual completion times.  
* Weekly summaries or tables help visualize where effort was concentrated.  

This approach aligns with Agile’s principle of *continuous improvement*.

== 3. Evidence-Based Scheduling (EBS) (Slides 49–60)
**Evidence-Based Scheduling (EBS)** refines time prediction using data from previous tasks.  
By comparing estimated time with actual duration, a *personal accuracy factor* is calculated for each contributor.  
Monte Carlo simulations (discussed in Slides 54–56) are used to estimate total project duration with realistic probability distributions.  
In Agile documentation, EBS can be integrated by:
* Logging both time estimates and outcomes per sprint.  
* Including histograms or summaries in the methodology appendix to illustrate forecast accuracy.  

This adds quantitative depth to the milestone documentation.

== 4. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) (Slides 61–70)
The **Work Breakdown Structure** decomposes large deliverables into smaller, measurable tasks.  
Each component should:
* Capture 100 % of the required work (*100 % rule*).  
* Avoid overlap with other tasks.  
* Represent a measurable outcome that can be completed in ≤ 80 hours (*80-hour rule*).  

For documentation, WBS diagrams clarify the relationship between major sections (e.g., User Profiles, Matchmaking, Documentation) and sub-tasks.  
Including a WBS chart in milestone reports improves readability and traceability.

== 5. Time Budgeting and Evaluation (Slides 71–86)
Effective time management depends on balancing categories such as classwork, documentation, meetings, and rest.  
A *time budget* defines how much effort should be spent per category and encourages gradual adjustments instead of drastic changes.  
Within team projects:
* Weekly or sprint-based time budgets can be created for documentation writing, reviewing, and editing.  
* These logs help detect under- or over-allocated effort early.  

The lecture highlights that managing time is not about finding more hours, but reallocating existing ones intelligently.

== 6. Application to Project Documentation
In the *Esports Organizer* project, these practices ensure that documentation evolves predictably:
* Time logs accompany each documentation issue (recording estimate vs. actual).  
* Retrospectives analyze discrepancies to improve future workload distribution.  
* WBS structures are used to divide large sections like “Profiles,” “Authentication,” and “Documentation” into smaller sub-issues.  

This process aligns with the course’s requirement for structured, evidence-based documentation.
