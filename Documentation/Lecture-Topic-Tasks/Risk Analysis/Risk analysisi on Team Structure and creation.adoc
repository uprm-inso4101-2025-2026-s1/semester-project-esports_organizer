== Risk Tree and Analysis for Team Creation

=== Introduction
This section presents a risk analysis for the *Team Creation* subsystem within the Esports Organizer Manager platform.  
Team creation is essential for organizing group-based tournaments, assigning captains, managing rosters, and ensuring the integrity of competitive structures.  
Failures in this subsystem can lead to inconsistent teams, broken tournament logic, or players being assigned to invalid or duplicated team states.

This risk analysis decomposes potential failures into structured branches and identifies where inconsistencies, validation errors, backend–frontend mismatches, or documentation gaps might corrupt the team creation process.

=== Purpose of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to:

* Identify the **top event** leading to team creation failure.
* Break it down into clear risk branches using a fault-tree model.
* Connect the failure modes to inconsistencies across documentation, API behavior, UX, and data models.
* Provide mitigation strategies and non-functional considerations.
* Support future formal verification or consistency-checking tasks.

This analysis focuses on *how a valid team fails to be created or becomes inconsistent*, not the general management of teams.

=== Top Event: Team Creation Failure

❌ *Team Creation Failure*  
A failure occurs when the system creates an invalid team, fails to create a team, or produces inconsistent data that breaks tournament logic.

Examples include:
* Team created without a captain  
* Duplicate team names  
* A user assigned to multiple teams simultaneously  
* Team created with missing or corrupted fields  
* UI indicates successful team creation but backend fails  
* Conflicting team size limits across modules

=== Risk Tree Structure and Branches

The following sections detail the major risk branches contributing to Team Creation Failure.

=== 1. Validation & Constraint Risks (T1–T3)

[cols="1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Risk ID | Description | Example Consequence

| T1 | Team created without required fields| Incomplete or unusable team records
| T2 | Team size validation missing or incorrect | Teams with too many or too few members
| T3 | Duplicate team names not prevented | Conflicting team identities in tournaments
|===

Mitigation strategies:
* Enforce server-side validation of all required fields.
* Apply unique constraints on team names.
* Add UI-level validation to prevent incomplete form submissions.

=== 2. Frontend–Backend Inconsistency Risks (F1–F3)

[cols="1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Risk ID | Description | Example Consequence

| F1 | Mismatched field names or missing request data | Backend receives incomplete team data
| F2 | UI indicates success but backend rejects creation | Users believe team exists when it does not
| F3 | Team creation logic differs between frontend and API docs | Conflicting expectations when creating teams
|===

Mitigation strategies:
* Synchronize API schemas through OpenAPI.
* Require documentation updates for all team-related changes.
* Add design-time and runtime request/response validation.

=== 3. Member Management Risks (V1–V3)

[cols="1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Risk ID | Description | Example Consequence

| V1 | User added to multiple teams simultaneously | Invalid tournament participation
| V2 | Captain role not properly updated or validated | Teams created without leadership structure
| V3 | Member removal/addition race conditions | Corrupted or duplicated roster entries
|===

Mitigation strategies:
* Enforce membership exclusivity rules.
* Validate captain assignment at both UI and backend layers.
* Use database transactions when updating rosters.

=== 4. Communication & Documentation Risks (C1–C3)

[cols="1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Risk ID | Description | Example Consequence

| C1 | Unclear definitions of “team,” “captain,” or “member” | Incorrect assumptions by developers
| C2 | Team size or eligibility rules not documented | Inconsistent enforcement across modules
| C3 | Incomplete documentation on team update workflows | Incorrect implementation of roster operations
|===

Mitigation strategies:
* Maintain a glossary for all team-related terminology.
* Document constraints (size, eligibility, roles) in the wiki.
* Track inconsistencies in the `#inconsistencies_channel`.

=== 5. Data Integrity & Storage Risks (D1–D3)

[cols="1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Risk ID | Description | Example Consequence

| D1 | Partial team data saved due to interrupted request | Broken team records
| D2 | No unique constraints on team IDs or captain IDs | Duplicate or corrupted relationships
| D3 | Outdated or cached team data overwritten | Loss of valid roster info
|===

Mitigation strategies:
* Ensure atomic DB operations for team creation and updates.
* Add unique and foreign-key constraints on team and user tables.
* Use versioned updates or optimistic locking.

=== Link to Lecture Topic Task: Identifying Inconsistencies

Many risks originate from inconsistencies such as:

* Terminological clashes: C1  
* Structural mismatches: F1, D1  
* Behavioral inconsistencies: F2, V1  
* Process/documentation issues: C2, C3  

This risk analysis supports the Identifying Inconsistencies task by showing exactly how mismatches propagate into invalid team states.

=== Conclusion

This risk analysis shows how *Team Creation Failure* can arise from validation errors, inconsistent cross-component communication, incorrect member management, or weak data integrity rules.  
By identifying these risks and applying mitigation strategies, the Esports Organizer Manager improves the reliability of its team management and ensures consistent tournament operations.
