This risk tree outlines the potential risks associated with granting the Admin role the permission to ban users. At the top the risk of such permission to an admin can have the risk of 2 things. It could take a permission misconfiguration route on where if not coded well this could lead to the action or permission of banning a user could be used by anyone since it never verified well if the user doing this action is really an admin which lead to a huge permission breach where anyone can just ban whoever they want. The other route is that even if the permission is well coded and verified, there is still a big risk that a rogue admin can be power hungry and ban users for no reason and because they wanted to at any time or any place, which this leads to user dissatisfaction due to the unfair banning of users because nobody likes to be banned for no reason.

To avoid such risks, it is important to implement strict permission checks in the code to ensure that only users with the Admin role can execute the ban user action. Additionally, having some sort alternative to trust users that want to be admins and giving them the role only if they are trusted enough to not abuse their power can help mitigate the risk of rogue admins banning users unfairly.
