= Risk Analysis and Management for the Notification System

Yamilet Gomez – Esports Organizer Project  
Team: Events & Notifications  
INSO4101-080

== 1. Objective
This document analyzes potential risks in the **Notification System** of the Esports Web Platform. The goal is to identify, assess, and mitigate risks affecting notification delivery, data integrity, usability, and security.

== 2. System Overview
The Notification System has two user views:

* **Players:**

  * Can view notifications.
  * Can access notification history.
  * Can mark all notifications as read (this deletes them).
  * Can save tournament events to Google Calendar using a reminder option.

* **Admins & Managers:**

  * Can view and delete notifications like players.
  * Can send notifications.
  * Must choose a **Team**, a **Title**, and a **Message** before sending.
  * All team members receive the notification.

== 3. Risk Analysis Concepts

* **Risk Identification:** Detecting what could go wrong.
* **Risk Assessment:** Estimating the likelihood and impact.
* **Risk Control:** Defining mitigation & contingency strategies.

== 4. Risk Matrix (Notification System)
[cols="1,1,1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Description | Mitigation

| Incorrect team targeted
| Medium
| High
| Admin/manager selects the wrong team and sends a notification to unintended users.
| Add confirmation modal; show team member preview before sending.

| Notification not delivered
| Medium
| High
| Firebase write failure or bad network causes missing notifications.
| Implement retries, success validation, and error logs.

| Duplicate notifications
| Low
| Medium
| Admins may accidentally send the same message twice.
| Add cooldown timer or detection of near-identical duplicates.

| Unauthorized notification sending
| Low
| High
| A regular user bypasses UI restrictions.
| Server-side role validation; Firebase security rules.



| Incorrect Google Calendar event time
| Low
| Medium
| Wrong timezone or reminder selection.
| Validate timezones; preview event before saving.

| Data inconsistency in notification history
| Medium
| Medium
| Desync between real-time notifications and history.
| Add sync check and fallback fetch.

| Overloading users with too many notifications
| Medium
| Low
| Team receives excessive notifications from managers.
| Add rate limits; send grouped notifications.

|===

== 5. Summary
Proactive risk management helps ensure the Notification System remains:

* Reliable for delivering tournament updates.
* Secure by restricting permissions.
* Usable for both players and managers.
* Integrated safely with Google Calendar.

By managing these risks early, the platform improves stability, user trust, and operational consistency.
