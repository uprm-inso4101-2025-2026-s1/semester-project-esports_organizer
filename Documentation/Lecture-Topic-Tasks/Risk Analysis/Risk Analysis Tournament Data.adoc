== Risk Matrix

|===
| *Risk* | *Impact* | *Likelihood* | *Mitigation*

| Concurrent Match Updates - Two organizers can update the match result at the same time, which can create conflicting or lost data.

| High - Data can be overwritten and create confliting results or inconsistent bracket progression

| Medium

| Implement Firestore transactions or batch writes to ensure atomic and serialized updates when multiple users modify match results simultaneously.
  Use optimistic concurrency control to detect conflicts before commit.


| Duplicate Registrations - A participant registers multiple times because of asynchronous UI upadtes or incorrect client validation

| Medium - Duplicate entries can cause unabalanced brackets or create inavlid matches

| High

| Validate unique participant identifiers both client-side and server-side before writing to the database.
  Apply composite indexes or use Firestore security rules to reject duplicate entries automatically.


| Broken NextMatch References - Incomplete propagation of winners due to missing or invalid Ids values for the next match

| High - Tournament progression could stop and the data integrity issues may prevent determining a winner

| Medium

| Perform pre-commit validation of all match dependencies. Each match should confirm that its `nextMatchId` field exists and correctly
  references a valid document. Introduce scheduled integrity checks to detect orphaned references.


| Incomplete Tournament Finalization - The tournament is marked as ended prematurely, even if there are unresolved matches or unreported results

| High - The system could mark the tournament as finisehd even if it still has matches to be started or finished

| Low

| Add server-side checks to verify all matches are complete before allowing the host or admin to finalize the tournament.
  Ensure that incomplete results cannot mark the tournament as “ended.”


| Unauthorized Data Modifications - Users without the proper authorization (TO or admin) attempt to change match results or tournament metadata

| Critical - Unauthorized User could alter the tournament structure or modify results.

| Low

| Enforce strict Firestore security rules to ensure only authorized roles (tournament organizers or admins) can modify sensitive tournament documents.
  Combine with Firebase Authentication for secure identity verification.
|===


== Conclusion

To maintain tournament data consistency, the platform requires control of concurrency, validation and proper user permissions.
Since the system handles real-time updates from multiple users (Tournament Organizers, admins and players) where they all interact with shared data,
synchronization errors can lead to inconsistent results or broken tournament logic.

The identified risk highlight the possible issues that could be faced when dealing with a event-driven system (Concurrent writes, duplicate data, etc).
Mitigation strategies such as Firestore transaction, pre-commit validation and restricting write permissions through Firebase Authentication and user
roles can help to ensure the tournament data is accurate.
