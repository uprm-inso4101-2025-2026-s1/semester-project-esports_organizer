= Understanding UI Components through Algebraic Thinking
Ronaldo Elier Flores Nazario, November 20, 2025

== Introduction
Algebraic thinking gives designers a systematic way to understand and structure UI components.  
Concepts such as sets, operations, relationships, and closure allow designers to perceive interfaces not just as isolated visuals, but as structured systems where components belong to well-defined groups and behave predictably.

Applying algebraic principles to UI components results in:
* Modularity  
* Predictability  
* Scalability  

== Core Algebraic Concepts

=== Carrier Set
This is the collection of all elements in the system.

*In algebra:* allowed values (real numbers, integers).  
*In UI design:* allowed components or component states.

UI Example — Button carrier set:
* Primary Button  
* Secondary Button  
* Icon Button  

=== Operations
Operations transform elements in the carrier set or combine them to produce new results.

UI Examples:
* `hover(button)`  
* `combine(card, button)`  
* `resize(component, sm)`  

=== Closure
Closure ensures operations always produce results that remain in the same component family.

Example:
* `addIcon(button)` → must still be a valid button variant.

== Connecting Algebra to UI Design

=== Carrier Sets → Component Libraries
Design systems group components into structured sets:
* Buttons
* Inputs
* Cards
* Navigation items

=== Operations → States & Modifiers
Operations correspond to:
* Hover  
* Focus  
* Disabled  
* Add icon  
* Combine components  

=== Closure → Consistency
Ensures:
* Valid spacing  
* Valid colors  
* Valid structure  

== Visual Representation

== Modular Design Through Algebraic Mindset
Algebra encourages:
* Systemic thinking  
* Predictable component behavior  
* Valid transformations  
* Scalability  

== Example from a Real Interface

=== Card Component in a Dashboard

Carrier Set:  
`{ small-card, medium-card, large-card }`

Operations:
* `addHeader(card)`  
* `attachButton(card)`  
* `expand(card)`  
* `hover(card)`  

Closure:
Resulting element must ALWAYS remain a valid Card.

== Reflection
Algebraic thinking strengthens design systems by:
* Predictability  
* Valid boundaries  
* Modularity  
* Easier maintenance  

It reinforces that design systems are structured, mathematical models—not random UI elements.
