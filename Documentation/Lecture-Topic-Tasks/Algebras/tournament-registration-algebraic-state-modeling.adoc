== Introduction
This document presents an algebraic model for the internal registration-status mechanism of the Esports Organizer system. Algebraic modeling provides a concise and mathematically grounded description of system behavior by defining a carrier set and a collection of closed operations over that set.

Tournament registration is a fundamental feature within the system. Players can join tournaments, withdraw, move to waitlists, or be promoted into open slots. These actions change the system’s internal state. An algebra offers a clear and unambiguous representation of these state transitions, ensuring consistency across backend logic, UI flow, and database operations.

== Purpose of the Algebra
The purpose of creating this algebra is to:

* Define all possible internal registration states in a single, explicit carrier set.
* Specify the operations that can transition the system between these states.
* Ensure closure, meaning every operation maps valid states to other valid states.
* Support verification, maintenance, and extension of the registration subsystem.

This model does not describe *how* the system implements registration; instead, it describes *what* states and transformations are permitted.

== Carrier Set (A)
The carrier set represents all the possible states of a player’s registration for a tournament:

----
A = { NotRegistered, Pending, Registered, Waitlisted, Withdrawn }
----

Each element describes a distinct phase in the player’s interaction with the registration process.

=== Meaning of Elements

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| State | Description

| *NotRegistered*
| Player has not yet attempted registration.

| *Pending*
| Registration request submitted; checks or processing underway.

| *Registered*
| Player successfully registered for the tournament.

| *Waitlisted*
| Tournament is full; player placed on the waiting list.

| *Withdrawn*
| Player was registered or waitlisted but has exited the registration process.
|===

== Operations (Ω)
The set of operations Ω defines which transitions between registration states are allowed.

[cols="1,1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Operation | Arity | Domain → Codomain | Description

| startRegistration
| 1
| NotRegistered → Pending
| Player initiates their registration. The system begins processing availability and requirements.

| confirmRegistration
| 1
| Pending → Registered
| Registration has been validated, and a slot is available.

| moveToWaitlist
| 1
| Pending → Waitlisted
| Tournament is full; request is moved to the waitlist queue.

| withdraw
| 1
| Registered → Withdrawn
| Player actively removes themselves from the tournament.

| promoteFromWaitlist
| 1
| Waitlisted → Registered
| A spot becomes free; the next player in line is promoted.
|===

== Closure of the Algebra
To show closure, we check that:

* Every operation takes an element of *A* as input.
* Every operation returns an element of *A* as output.
* No operation produces undefined, external, or invalid states.

Formally:

----
∀ f ∈ Ω,  f : A → A
----

Therefore, the algebra (A, Ω) is **closed**.

== Design Benefits
Using algebraic modeling for the registration subsystem provides:

* *Predictability*: All transitions follow strict rules.
* *Consistency*: Prevents illegal or contradictory state changes.
* *Maintainability*: Adding or modifying operations becomes straightforward.
* *Verifiability*: Mathematical structure supports correctness checking.
* *Shared Understanding*: Developers, analysts, and designers can refer to one authoritative model.

== Conclusion
The algebraic model defined here formalizes the registration-status mechanism within the Esports Organizer system. By specifying a closed carrier set and well-defined operations, the system gains clarity, structure, and reliability. This approach supports development and maintenance by ensuring that all valid state transitions are explicit, consistent, and mathematically grounded.
