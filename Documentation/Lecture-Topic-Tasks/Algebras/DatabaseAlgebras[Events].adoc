= *Database Algebras*

*Events:*
For events in the esports organizer the following algebra can be used to describe the processes that are applied to them in the database.

_(N_ U _B, {addEventToDatabase: E -> B, deleteEvent: EventID -> B, isEventInDatabase: E -> B, getEventFromFirestore: EventID -> N})_

Where:
*N U B* : Is the set of elements on which operations can be applied to.

*E* : Represents the set of events.

*N* : Represents the set of events with the addition of a null element, which can be described as _N = E U {none}_.

*B* : Represents the set of Boolean values _{true, false}_.

*addEventToDatabase* : Takes an event object as a parameter, if it is not in the database, it is added to the database. Returns a Boolean to show if the event was added successfully or not; returns true if the event was added and false if the event could not be added.

*deleteEvent* : Takes an Event's ID, such as its name, and removes the corresponding event from the database if it was found. Returns true if the event was removed and false otherwise.

*isEventInDatabase* : Takes an Event and checks if an event in the database has the same ID/name as the provided event. Returns a Boolean to indicate if the event was found.

*getEventFromFirestore* : takes an Event ID and searches in the database for an event that has a matching ID. Returns the found event and a null object if the event was not found.
