= Qualitative vs Quantitative Risk Assessment – Player & Team Profiles
Jael Rodriguez – Esports Organizer Project  
Team: Player & Profiles  
INSO4101-080

== 1. Understanding Risk in Player & Team Profiles
Risks in the profile system involve uncertainties that may compromise profile integrity, team
membership, role accuracy, competitive fairness, or data synchronization. These include incorrect
role assignments, desynchronized ranks, or players appearing in multiple rosters.

== 2. Qualitative Risk Assessment for Profiles
This evaluation uses descriptive labels to classify likelihood and severity. Examples include:
- Likely: Profile updates not syncing before tournament check-in.
- Possible: Non-captain players modifying sensitive profile attributes.
- Unlikely: Duplicate player records created during simultaneous registration.
Severity examples include High (eligibility impact), Moderate (visual inconsistency), and Low
(non-critical info).

== 3. Quantitative Risk Assessment for Profiles
This method assigns numeric values:
Likelihood: 0.1–1.0
Severity: 1–10
Exposure = Likelihood × Severity
Example:
Risk: Player rank fails to update before a tournament.
Likelihood: 0.3
Severity: 9
Exposure: 0.3 × 9 = 2.7

== 4. Comparison in the Context of Profiles
Qualitative assessment is ideal for early detection of profile-related vulnerabilities such as
permission conflicts.
Quantitative assessment is better for prioritizing technical fixes when data accuracy or eligibility
is at stake.
Using both approaches ensures robust protection of competitive integrity and player data
consistency.
== 5. Applied Example – Esports Organizer
Risk: A player appears on two team rosters due to synchronization delays.
Qualitative: Possible, Severe
Quantitative: Likelihood 0.2, Severity 10 → Exposure = 2.0
Mitigation: Enforce atomic database transactions and lock roster updates until completion to
prevent duplication.
