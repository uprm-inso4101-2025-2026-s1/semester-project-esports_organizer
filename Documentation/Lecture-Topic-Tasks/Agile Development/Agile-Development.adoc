= Agile Foundations in Milestone 2 Development

== Introduction

I created the goals and structure for Milestone 2 with the explicit purpose of turning our early research into a working, testable foundation. The aim was clear: by the end of the milestone, the tournament flow from authentication to bracket progression and result tracking had to function end-to-end with real users. Every deliverable was framed using Agile principles: tight iteration loops, early feedback, and testable value delivery. We didn’t aim for feature completeness we aimed for usable functionality that could evolve with feedback.

== Agile in Practice

Rather than dictating features from a distance, I translated functional goals into backlog items directly tied to real world use cases:

* **Authentication and Role-Based Access** – Treated as essential scaffolding, owned jointly by the database and profile teams, with validation tied to permissions and profile visibility.
* **Real-Time Participation and Bracket Updates** – Implemented by Social Features with schema support from Database and tested through full-cycle tournament simulations.
* **Cross Team UI Consistency** – Managed by UX, ensuring all workflows (login, registration, bracket view, event view) were accessible and responsive across devices.
* **Event System Integration** – Defined a separate user-centered flow that paralleled the tournament system but with emphasis on discoverability and reminders.

== Incremental Delivery & Cross Team Collaboration

Every team operated within an Agile framework:
* Feature implementations were verified in isolation, then tested together.
* User facing goals were broken into weekly deliverables, such as mockups, flow charts, and schema diagrams.
* I facilitated coordination between teams by embedding the database team across all feature teams and aligning deliverables around user flows, not code modules.

== Feedback and Adaptation

* We conducted structured user testing with 4–6 participants covering registration, participation, match resolution, and event reminders.
* Real time feedback influenced interface tweaks and event notifications.
* Performance was validated under real conditions, ensuring bracket updates within 2 seconds and compatibility across platforms.

== Agile Success Criteria Achieved

These were not abstract goals, they were clearly defined critical factors:

* Tournament and event flows worked end-to-end.
* Notifications triggered as expected across use cases.
* User profiles reflected history and role-accurate data.
* Database schema remained stable across evolving feature sets.
* Structured feedback confirmed the system was usable and intuitive.

== Conclusion

This milestone wasn’t just about shipping features—it was about proving that Agile can structure a system that is both technically sound and user ready. The goals I defined translated lecture theory into working practice. I didn’t just manage tasks—I orchestrated the flow of progress across five teams, ensuring every iteration brought us closer to a real, functioning esports platform. This was Agile not as a buzzword, but as a discipline of planning, delivery, and adaptation.
