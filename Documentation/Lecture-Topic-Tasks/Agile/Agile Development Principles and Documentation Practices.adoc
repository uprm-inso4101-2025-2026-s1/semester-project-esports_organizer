= Agile Development Principles and Documentation Practices

== Introduction
Agile development is an *attitude* rather than a strict process or methodology.  
It emphasizes adaptability, collaboration, and continuous improvement.  
As stated in the lecture by Prof. Marko Schütz-Schmuck, *"Scrum, Kanban, and other frameworks are only starting points — teams own their process."*  

Agile’s foundation comes from the https://agilemanifesto.org/[Agile Manifesto], which defines four key values and twelve guiding principles.  
These principles promote flexibility, communication, and responsiveness to change — all of which are essential in software engineering projects such as the *Esports Organizer*.

== Agile Values and Their Documentation Impact
Agile’s four values directly shape how documentation is created and maintained within a team:

|===
| Agile Value | Documentation Implication

| *Individuals and interactions over processes and tools*
| Documentation should *enhance communication* rather than replace it. Notes, summaries, and diagrams are preferred over long, rigid manuals.

| *Working software over comprehensive documentation*
| Documentation focuses on *clarity and usability* — short, precise explanations that help developers deliver working features efficiently.

| *Customer collaboration over contract negotiation*
| Meeting notes, user stories, and change logs ensure *traceability* of what users request and how the team responds.

| *Responding to change over following a plan*
| Documentation remains *living and iterative*, adapting as the project evolves.

== Scrum Framework Overview
Scrum is one of the most commonly used Agile frameworks.  
It structures work into time-boxed iterations known as *sprints*, emphasizing transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

=== Scrum Artifacts
* **Product Backlog:** A master list of all desired features, improvements, and documentation tasks. Each item should follow the INVEST principle (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Testable).  
* **Sprint Backlog:** The selected items for the current sprint, including documentation deliverables and assigned contributors.  
* **Deliverables:** Outputs of a sprint — these may be software features, updated documents, bug fixes, or diagrams.  
* **User Stories:** Describe functionality from the end-user’s perspective.  
  Example: _"As a player, I want to customize my profile so I can represent my team’s brand."_  
  Each story is later documented in the backlog and referenced in the project’s documentation.

== Agile Meetings and Their Documentation Outputs
Each Scrum meeting produces written or visual records that contribute to team knowledge and traceability:

|===
| Meeting | Typical Documentation Outcome

| *Sprint Planning*
| Meeting notes summarizing selected backlog items, sprint goals, and estimated completion dates.

| *Daily Stand-Up*
| Short text updates (1–2 sentences) describing what was done, what is next, and any blockers.

| *Sprint Review*
| A summary of completed deliverables, screenshots, or links to demo features.

| *Backlog Grooming*
| Updated backlog list with improved descriptions and priority tags.

| *Retrospective*
| Reflections on what went well, what can improve, and documentation process changes.

== The Role of Documentation in Agile Teams
In traditional software processes, documentation was static and produced at the end.  
In Agile, documentation is *continuous* — it evolves along with the software.

Good documentation in Agile serves several purposes:
* Promotes transparency within the team.  
* Keeps track of decisions made during meetings.  
* Connects user stories, code, and features with a clear narrative.  
* Serves as onboarding material for new members joining the project.  

Within the *Esports Organizer* project, this approach ensures that documentation reflects the real progress of the development teams — not just plans, but outcomes.  
Each milestone expands the project’s documentation incrementally, making it both detailed and up-to-date.

== Application to the Esports Organizer Project
For the *Profiles Team*, Agile principles are applied as follows:
* Documentation is versioned alongside code to ensure alignment.  
* Sub-issues for each documentation section (e.g., “Profile Privacy Toggles”) follow the backlog structure.  
* Sprint retrospectives are summarized directly in the documentation to keep a written record of improvements.  
* Task issues are linked to documentation updates, ensuring traceability between deliverables and the learning process.

This methodology reinforces accountability and collaboration across all team members, ensuring that every sprint produces not only functional progress but also meaningful documentation growth.
