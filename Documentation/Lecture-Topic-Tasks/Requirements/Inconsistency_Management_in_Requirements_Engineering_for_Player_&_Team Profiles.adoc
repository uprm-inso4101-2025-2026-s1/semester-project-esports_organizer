= Inconsistency Management in Requirements Engineering – Player & Team Profiles
Jael Rodriguez – Esports Organizer Project  
Team: Player & Profiles  
INSO4101-080

== 1. Understanding Inconsistency in Player & Team Profiles
In the Player & Team Profiles module, inconsistencies arise when profile attributes, permissions,
or team-related data contradict each other across requirements. Because players, captains, and
administrators interact with the profile subsystem in different ways, inconsistencies are common
and must be identified early to prevent corrupt data states, roster contradictions, or permission
misuse.

== 2. Types of Inconsistencies in the Profiles Module
• Terminology Clash: Terms like 'Role', 'Position', and 'Team Role' may be used inconsistently
between teams.
• Designation Clash: The term 'Captain' might refer to the team founder in one requirement but to
a squad manager in another.
• Structure Clash: Modeling ranks as a single numeric score versus a tiered structure leads to
design issues.
• Strong Conflict: 'Players may join only one team' vs. 'Players may belong to multiple practice
squads.'
• Weak Conflict: Players can edit their profiles anytime, but certain edits (competitive ranks)
should be restricted during tournaments.

== 3. Root Causes in Profile Requirements
Conflicts emerge from:
- Diverse stakeholder interpretations (admins vs. captains).
- Ambiguous boundaries between editable and non-editable attributes.
- Overlapping permissions for managing player roles.
- Evolving definitions of what counts as competitive-impacting data.
These conflicts reflect natural domain evolution within the competitive esports environment.

== 4. Structured Conflict Management for Profiles
A systematic approach includes:
=== 1. Identifying overlapping attributes (rank, roles, eligibility).
=== 2. Analyzing permission flows between players, captains, and admins.
=== 3. Documenting inconsistencies using diagrams or traceability tables.
=== 4. Proposing resolutions (conditional updates, captain approval flows).
=== 5. Selecting solutions based on fairness, data integrity, and tournament rules.
This ensures a consistent, reliable profile system.

== 5. Applied Example – Esports Organizer
Requirement A: Players may freely update their profile information.
Requirement B: Captains must approve changes to attributes that impact competitive eligibility.
Resolution: Allow unrestricted edits to non-competitive attributes while routing sensitive
changes (rank, role, team status) through a captain approval system to avoid conflicts during
tournaments.
