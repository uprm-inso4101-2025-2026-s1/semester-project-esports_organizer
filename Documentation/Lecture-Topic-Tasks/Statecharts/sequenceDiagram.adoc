= Sequence Diagram for Posting and Displaying Community Feed Updates
Esports Organizer

== Summary
This document provides a brief description of the sequence of interactions that occur when a user creates a new post and the system updates the Community Feed; the diagram illustrates the communication between the user interface, backend/database, and feed display components.

The purpose of this sequence diagram is to show how user actions trigger system processes and how the system responds by validating, storing, and rendering new community posts.
