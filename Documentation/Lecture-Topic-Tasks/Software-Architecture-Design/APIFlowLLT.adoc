*Lecture Topic Task - API Integration Flow Diagram*

*By:* Sebastian A Santiago Perez

*Course:* INSO 4101 – Software Engineering

*Date:* November 2, 2025

*Introduction*

This lecture topic task focuses on the concept of API Integration and
its role in connecting the

frontend and backend systems of the Esports Organizer platform. API
integration allows data to be

exchanged between user interfaces and backend services in real time.
Understanding this flow is

essential to ensure that information moves efficiently through the
application, allowing users to access

accurate and updated data without needing to reload or manually refresh
the page.

*Relation to Class Topics*

This topic connects directly to the Software Design and Human–Computer
Interaction (HCI) lectures,

This topic connects to *Software Design* and *System Architecture*
lectures, specifically focusing on

modularity, communication layers, and coupling between system
components. In the Triptych Model,

this concept bridges the *requirements* and *design* phases—where the
functional need for data

exchange is defined and then implemented through structured interfaces
and endpoints. The use of

APIs also aligns with software engineering principles of reusability and
separation of concerns, since

each layer performs a clear and independent role.

*Objective*

The main objective of this task is to document and visualize how the
Esports Organizer frontend

communicates with the backend through APIs. The diagram aims to show how
user actions trigger

API requests, how data is retrieved from the database, and how the
responses are processed and

displayed on the user interface. This analysis helps the team understand
the internal communication

flow and dependencies between components, which is crucial for
maintainability and debugging.

*Process and Design Decisions*

The process began by identifying which components of the platform
interact directly with backend

services, such as the *Login*, *Register*, and *Events* sections. Each
of these components sends requests

to the backend to either fetch or submit data.

When a user performs an action, such as logging in or viewing
tournaments, the frontend sends a

request to the corresponding API endpoint. The backend receives this
request, processes it, and

returns a structured response—typically in JSON format. The frontend
then updates its state and

re-renders the interface to reflect the new data.Through this process,
the system maintains a real-time connection between user actions and
database

updates, ensuring data integrity and responsiveness.

*Example Scenario*

For example, when a user logs into the Esports Organizer platform, the
frontend component

collects the credentials and sends them to the authentication API. The
API verifies the

credentials, retrieves the user’s data from Firebase, and sends it back
to the frontend. The

React component then updates the state and navigates the user to their
dashboard,

displaying personalized information.

This process occurs seamlessly, giving the appearance of an
instantaneous response and

reinforcing a smooth user experience.

*Connection with Software Engineering Principles*

The process of implementing responsive design aligns with several key
engineering practices:

●Modularity**:** Layout components are reusable and independent.

●Maintainability**:** CSS variables and consistent design tokens
simplify future edits.

●Scalability**:** The design supports additional sections (like Events
or News) without major

refactoring.

●User-Centered Design**:** Prioritizing accessibility and legibility
enhances user satisfaction and

engagement.

*Reflections and Findings*

This task demonstrates how API integration supports the overall
structure of the Esports Organizer by

enabling modular communication between the frontend and backend. It also
highlights the importance

of error handling and asynchronous operations, as delays or failures in
API communication can

directly affect user experience. Properly designed APIs and
well-structured data handling reduce

coupling, making the system easier to maintain and scale in future
iterations.

*Conclusion*

The API Integration Flow Diagram provides a clear visualization of how
information travels through

the system and how the frontend and backend cooperate to deliver dynamic
content. By documenting

this flow, the development team gains a deeper understanding of data
dependencies and component

responsibilities. This ensures a more stable, maintainable, and
efficient application architecture for the

Esports Organizer platform.
