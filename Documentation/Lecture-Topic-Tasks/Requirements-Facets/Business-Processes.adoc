= Business Processes in Esports Tournament Workflows

== Introduction
Business processes describe the real-world sequence of actions that stakeholders follow to complete a goal.
In requirements engineering, they ensure that the system to be respects the natural order of domain activities instead of forcing artificial workflows. 
For esports platforms, tournament operations depend on clear and time sensitive processes.

== Definition
A business process is a domain level description of the tasks, decisions, and interactions that occur to achieve a specific outcome. 
These workflows exist before software design and help transform domain understanding into functional system requirements.

== Application in the Project
Our project relied on translating the real tournament lifecycle into actionable requirements. 
The key workflow involved: registration, availability checks, seeding, bracket progression, and result reporting. 
Since bracket research was incomplete in Milestone 1, business processes helped us restructure Milestone 2 around the correct domain logic.

== My Contribution
As the manager, I organized the core tournament workflow and demonstrated to developers why the bracket process had to be the system’s foundation.
This ensured that our implementation reflected real esports operations and prevented teams from creating a out of order or domain inaccurate features.
