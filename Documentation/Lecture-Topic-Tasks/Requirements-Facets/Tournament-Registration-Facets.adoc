= Requirements Facet Extraction for Tournament Registration
Yasser Alonso Ruiz, November 26, 2025

== Introduction
Tournament Registration is a core subsystem of the Esports Organizer. Its purpose is to allow players and teams to join tournaments under specific rules, constraints, and eligibility conditions.
Extracting requirement facets clarifies how the system should behave, what data it needs, how it interacts with Firestore, and how it must handle errors or authorization.  
This structured breakdown ensures consistency across backend logic, improves developer understanding, and reduces ambiguity during implementation.

== Diagram: Requirements Facet Map
The following diagram visually represents all requirement facets extracted for the Tournament Registration subsystem.  
It maps the root concept *Tournament Registration* to seven major requirement dimensions:

- Functional  
- Behavioral  
- Data  
- Interaction  
- Authorization  
- Error  
- Constraint  

Each facet contains example responsibilities or rules, forming a clear hierarchical map of the subsystem.

== Selected Functional Area
- Tournament Registration (solo & team modes)
- Registration/Unregistration flow
- Firestore interaction for registration state

== Requirement Facets and Verification Methods

=== 1. Functional Facet
- Defines what actions the registration system must support, including registering, unregistering, checking eligibility, preventing duplicates, and updating tournament metadata.

*Verification:*  
Check Firestore writes (`registeredPlayers`, `registeredTeams`, `registeredCount`) and ensure allowed/blocked actions match expected rules.

=== 2. Behavioral Facet
- Specifies how the system reacts to events such as registration attempts, cancelations, or invalid actions. This includes triggering notifications, rejecting duplicate entries, and auto-updating counts.

*Verification:*  
Execute onboarding scenarios (first-time registration, repeat attempts, capacity-full cases) and confirm the system reacts according to expected behavior models.

=== 3. Data Facet
- Identifies required data to process registration: Player ID, Team ID, Tournament ID, mode (solo/team), capacity, eligibility rules, and registration deadlines.

*Verification:*  
Inspect Firestore documents and confirm all required fields exist and are consumed correctly in registration logic.

=== 4. Interaction Facet
- Describes how the registration feature communicates with backend modules such as Firestore, authentication, and notifications.
This includes reads/writes, consistency checks, and condition-based queries.

*Verification:*  
Review Firestore logs and network calls to confirm correct collection usage and proper update sequencing.

=== 5. Authorization Facet
- Specifies who is allowed to perform registration actions.
Players can self-register; team captains may register entire teams; admins can override eligibility or deadlines when necessary.

*Verification:*  
Attempt registrations with different roles (regular player, captain, admin) and confirm permissions match the system rules.

=== 6. Error Facet
- Covers how the system handles invalid scenarios such as full capacity, network failures, duplicate registrations, or missed deadlines.

*Verification:*  
Trigger error states intentionally and verify correct feedback, Firestore rollback, and accurate prevention of inconsistent data.

=== 7. Constraint Facet
- Defines restrictions such as registration deadlines, maximum capacity, eligibility requirements, and one-tournament-per-player limits (if enabled).

*Verification:*  
Adjust parameters and confirm the system enforces constraints consistently.

== Summary
These requirement facets establish a clear structure for understanding and implementing Tournament Registration in the Esports Organizer system.
They define what the feature must do, how it behaves, what data it needs, and what rules shape its execution.
Following these facets ensures consistent backend behavior, reduces logical ambiguity, prevents registration errors, and improves reliability across the app.
