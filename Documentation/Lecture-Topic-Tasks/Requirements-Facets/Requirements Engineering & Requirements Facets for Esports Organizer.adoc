== 1. Overview
This document defines the requirements of the *Esports Organizer Platform* using Requirements Engineering principles and the five RE facets.
It clarifies what the system must do, the constraints it must follow, and the expectations of users and stakeholders.

== 2. System Goals
* Allow users to create, join, and manage esports events.
* Provide player profiles with roles, games, and participation history.
* Deliver reminders and event notifications reliably.
* Enforce role-based permissions (Player, Organizer, Admin).

== 3. Requirements by Facet

=== 3.1 Functional Requirements (FR)
|===
|ID | Requirement | Description

|FR1 | Users shall create events with title, game, date/time, and limits. | Supports event lifecycle.
|FR2 | Users shall join existing events. | Participant management.
|FR3 | The system shall store participated events in the user profile. | Visible in PlayerProfile.
|FR4 | Users shall update their profile (bio, username, flag, games). | Profile editing.
|FR5 | The system shall send reminders before event start. | Supports notification scheduling.
|FR6 | The system shall notify participants when an event is edited or cancelled. | Ensures accuracy.
|FR7 | The system shall display a user’s past and upcoming events. | Visibility feature.
|FR8 | The system shall enforce permissions for editing profiles and events. | Security & roles.
|===

=== 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
|===
|ID | Requirement | Description
|NFR1 | Notifications must be delivered no later than 1 minute after scheduled time. | Timeliness.
|NFR2 | UI must load the profile page within 2 seconds on a typical connection. | Performance.
|NFR3 | The system must prevent unauthorized edits. | Security.
|NFR4 | User actions should be consistent across devices. | Usability & consistency.
|===

=== 3.3 Stakeholder Requirements
|===
|ID | Requirement | Stakeholder
|SR1 | Players want to easily join events. | Player
|SR2 | Organizers want clear event management workflows. | Organizer
|SR3 | Admins require visibility and control over user accounts. | Admin
|SR4 | Users want reliable notifications. | All
|===

=== 3.4 Environmental / Context Requirements
|===
|ID | Requirement | Description
|ER1 | System relies on Firebase Firestore for data. | Persistence constraint.
|ER2 | Authentication is performed via Firebase Auth or local credentials. | Environment constraint.
|ER3 | Runs as a browser-based React application. | Execution environment.
|===

=== 3.5 Domain & Business Constraints
|===
|ID | Requirement | Description
|DC1 | Event must have a valid date/time in the future. | Domain rule.
|DC2 | Users may only have roles defined in the system’s role model. | Constraint.
|DC3 | Reminder time depends on user preferences (offset). | Domain logic.
|DC4 | A user cannot join an event beyond defined limits. | Business rule.
|===

== 4. Requirements Facet Classification Table
|===
|Requirement | Facet | Notes
|Join Event | Functional | Uses Firestore & UI
|Only Admins can delete profiles | Constraint | Role-based access
|Event reminders must be timely | NFR | Timeliness/Correctness
|Profile uses Firebase Auth | Environmental | Platform dependency
|Show participated events | Functional | Profile integration
|===

== 5. Use Case: Join Event

=== 5.1 Name
Join Event

=== 5.2 Primary Actor
Player

=== 5.3 Preconditions
* User is authenticated.
* Event exists and has available space.

=== 5.4 Trigger
User clicks **Join Event**.

=== 5.5 Main Flow
1. User requests to join.
2. React client sends `POST /events/{id}/join`.
3. Event Manager validates participation.
4. The system adds user to event participants.
5. User’s `participatedEvents` list is updated.
6. If reminders are enabled → Scheduler schedules a reminder.
7. System returns success.

=== 5.6 Exceptions
* Event full → Reject with message.
* User already joined → No duplicate entry.
* Event cancelled → Reject.

=== 5.7 Postconditions
* User is listed as a participant.
* Reminder job exists in Notification Scheduler.

== 6. Identified Gaps & Ambiguities
* Permission enforcement currently occurs only on client; backend rules needed.
* Notification reliability requirement not formally defined.
* Event cancellation rules (timing, notification expectations) need refinement.
* User preference model for reminders could require more structure.

== 7. Summary
This requirements document defines what the Esports Organizer must support and clarifies system behavior using the five RE facets.
It serves as a foundation for improving architecture, implementation, and consistency across the platform.
