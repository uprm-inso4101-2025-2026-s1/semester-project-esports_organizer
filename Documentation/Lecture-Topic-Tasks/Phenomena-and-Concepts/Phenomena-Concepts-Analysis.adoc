== 1. Overview
This document identifies the key *phenomena* and *concepts* relevant to the Esports Organizer platform.
It clarifies how the system observes, reacts to, and represents real-world user behavior.

== 2. Phenomena

=== 2.1 World Phenomena
(Things happening in the real world, outside the system)

* W1: A player decides to join an esports event.
* W2: An organizer chooses to create or edit an event.
* W3: Users form teams or plan participation.
* W4: Users expect reminders or updates before events start.
* W5: An event occurs at a specific real-world date/time.

=== 2.2 Machine Phenomena
(Behaviors controlled entirely by the system)

* M1: System stores event and profile data in Firestore.
* M2: System schedules notifications and reminders.
* M3: System enforces role-based permissions (e.g., admin vs. player).
* M4: PlayerProfile renders participated events and favorite games.
* M5: Notification Service sends reminder messages.
* M6: UI updates dynamically when data changes.

=== 2.3 Shared Phenomena
(Interactions between user actions and system responses)

* S1: User clicks **Join Event** → System updates participants list.
* S2: Organizer edits event → System updates event data and reschedules reminders.
* S3: User updates profile → System stores changes (bio, username, country).
* S4: System sends notifications → User reads reminder or update.
* S5: User views PlayerProfile → System retrieves profile and participatedEvents.

== 3. Concepts

=== 3.1 Core Domain Concepts
|===
| Concept | Description

| Event | A scheduled competitive match with game, time, participants, and limits.
| Player Profile | Representation of a user (username, bio, country, avatar, games, participatedEvents).
| Participation | The relationship between a user and an event they have joined.
| Notification | A reminder or announcement triggered by system logic.
| Role | User type (Player, Organizer, Admin) determining permissions.
| Team | Optional grouping of players for team-based events.
| Scheduler | Component responsible for scheduling reminder triggers.

== 4. Linking Phenomena to Concepts

* W1 + S1 → *Participation* concept
When a player decides to join an event (world), the system updates participants (shared).

* W4 + M2 → *Notification* concept
Users expect reminders (world), and the system schedules them (machine).

* W2 + S2 → *Event* concept
Organizers modify events (world), and the system updates and propagates changes (shared).

* S3 + M1 → *Player Profile* concept
User edits profile (shared), system persists updates (machine).

* W5 + M2 → *Scheduler* concept
Real-world event time influences internal reminder logic.

== 5. Summary
This Phenomena & Concepts analysis reveals how the Esports Organizer system maps real-world actions into system-controlled behaviors.
Understanding these relationships helps ensure that requirements are grounded in actual user behavior and domain semantics.
