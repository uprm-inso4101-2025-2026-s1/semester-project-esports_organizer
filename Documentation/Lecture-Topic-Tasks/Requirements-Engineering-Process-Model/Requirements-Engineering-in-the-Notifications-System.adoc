= Requirements Engineering in the Esports Web – Notifications System

Team: Events & Notifications  
INSO4101-080

==  Objective

This document explains the concept and process of *Requirements Engineering (RE)* and analyzes how it applies to the *Notifications System* of the Esports Organizer Web Platform.

The goal is to demonstrate how RE helps define, validate, and manage project goals effectively, ensuring that the notification features align with user needs, system constraints, and overall platform objectives.

== Definition

According to the IEEE, a requirement is:
[quote]
____
A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective.
____

*Requirements Engineering* is the systematic process of defining, documenting, and maintaining these requirements throughout the software development lifecycle. It acts as a bridge between what users expect and what developers implement.

For the *Esports Web Notifications System*, RE ensures that the platform reliably informs users about tournaments and community activities while maintaining usability, efficiency, and flexibility through features like *Save to Google Calendar* and *Mark All as Read*.

== Purpose and Importance of Requirements Engineering

Requirements Engineering provides a structured way to manage complexity in software projects.

Its main purposes are to:

* Ensure a clear understanding of what the notification system must achieve before development begins.
* Facilitate effective communication between developers, designers, and stakeholders.
* Avoid ambiguity by defining precise, testable requirements (e.g., “The system shall send real-time notifications for tournament updates”).
* Detect and resolve conflicts early (e.g., scheduling notifications and Google Calendar integration).
* Serve as a foundation for subsequent phases like design, testing, and maintenance.
* Guarantee that all user expectations are covered without unnecessary functionality.

In this context, Requirements Engineering ensures that the *Notifications System* delivers accurate, timely, and meaningful updates to users, enhancing engagement and reliability across the Esports platform.

== Five Phases of Requirements Engineering

Requirements Engineering consists of five main phases that ensure clarity, feasibility, and alignment with user goals.

=== 1. Elicitation (Requirements Gathering)

This phase focuses on understanding what users and stakeholders need from the *Notifications System*.  
Methods include interviews, feedback sessions, and prototype testing.

**Examples in the Esports Web:**

* Gathering organizer needs to send tournament invitations and reminders.
* Identifying user preferences for community post notifications.
* Discussing integration with Google Calendar for scheduling upcoming tournaments.

[example]
 Example Requirement: “The system shall notify users 24 hours before a tournament begins and provide an option to save the event to Google Calendar.”

=== 2. Analysis

This phase analyzes gathered information to detect conflicts, clarify priorities, and ensure logical consistency.

**Examples in the Esports Web:**

* Determining notification types: tournament, community, or platform updates.
* Identifying dependencies (e.g., tournament notifications depend on schedule data).
* Ensuring compatibility between real-time notifications and “Mark All as Read” functionality.

[example]
 Example Outcome: Define that unread notifications persist until explicitly marked as read by the user.

=== 3. Specification

This phase documents requirements in a structured, formal way for development reference.

**Examples in the Esports Web:**

* *Functional Requirement:* The system shall display all unread notifications in descending order of date.
* *Non-functional Requirement:* Notifications must appear in under two seconds after an event is triggered.
* *Integration Requirement:* Users shall be able to add tournament dates to Google Calendar directly from the notification.

This specification ensures that each feature is measurable, testable, and traceable.

=== 4. Validation and Verification

Once requirements are written, they are validated with users and verified against technical constraints.

**Validation examples:**

* Reviewing prototypes to ensure the “Save to Google Calendar” button works intuitively.
* Confirming that help page content is accessible and useful to all users.

**Verification examples:**

* Testing that real-time notifications work across different devices.
* Ensuring that marking all notifications as read updates the user interface correctly.

[example]
 Goal: Ensure that “the system does what users expect” and “users expect what the system does.”

=== 5. Management

Requirements must be tracked and updated as the platform evolves.  
The *Notifications System* may require changes based on new community features, APIs, or design updates.

**Examples in the Esports Web:**

* Updating requirements when introducing new types of notifications.
* Maintaining documentation of changes (e.g., new filters or categories).
* Ensuring stakeholders approve major modifications, such as new calendar integration behavior.

== Application to the Notifications System

|===
| *Phase* | *Example in Project*

| *Elicitation*
| Gather user needs for tournament reminders and community updates.

| *Analysis*
| Identify dependencies between event creation and notification triggers.

| *Specification*
| Write use cases for “Save to Google Calendar” and “Mark All as Read.”

| *Validation*
| Review prototypes with users to ensure clarity and usefulness.

| *Management*
| Update documentation when new notification types are added.

== Conclusion

Through these phases, the *Notifications System* ensures that all alerts are timely, relevant, and aligned with user expectations while maintaining scalability and usability across the Esports platform.

The use of Requirements Engineering principles allows developers and stakeholders to maintain a shared vision, trace progress efficiently, and guarantee that the system meets the functional and experiential goals of the Esports Web environment.
