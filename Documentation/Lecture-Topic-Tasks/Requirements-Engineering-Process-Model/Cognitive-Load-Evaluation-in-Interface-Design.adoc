= Cognitive Load Evaluation in Interface Design for Esports Organizer

== Introduction: Cognitive Load in UI/UX
Cognitive Load Theory describes how much mental effort a user must spend to understand and complete a task.

In interface design, high cognitive load often appears when:

* The UI requires remembering steps or information
* There is unclear feedback
* The navigation is confusing
* Visual clutter forces users to scan too much
* Tasks require multiple unnecessary actions

Lowering cognitive load makes interfaces quicker to use, more intuitive, and less prone to errors.

== UI Tasks Evaluated
For this analysis, three key interactions were evaluated within the *Esports Organizer* platform:

1. Login / Sign Up Flow
2. Tournament Creation Initial Form
3. Navigation Bar Menu Switching

== Cognitive Load Analysis Tables

.Cognitive Load Analysis for Login/Signup Flow
[cols="2,2,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Task | User Effort Level | Issue Identified | Suggested Improvement

| Enter email and password | Low | None | Maybe add focus color when typing in a specific field
| Submit login | Low | No system response when accessing the database | Add a loading state when creating a new account or fetching user preferences from the database
| Toggle password visibility | Low | Icon meaning (eye/eye-slash) might be unclear for some users | Add tooltip or label: "Show password"
|===

.Cognitive Load Analysis for Tournament Creation
[cols="2,2,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Task | User Effort Level | Issue Identified | Suggested Improvement

| Select tournament type | Medium | Options are too precise and generic | Add game-specific options system that varies depending on the game
| Fill basic info (name, region, etc.) | Medium | Majority of basic info is asked except region | Add region selection field
| Click "Continue" | Medium | No immediate confirmation that data was saved | Add small success banner or "Saved ✓" indicator
|===

.Cognitive Load Analysis for Navigation Bar Menu Switching
[cols="2,2,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Task | User Effort Level | Issue Identified | Suggested Improvement

| Locate the current page via navbar | Low | None | N/A
| Switch between dashboards, teams, tournaments | Medium | Some categories feel visually equal even if they differ in importance | Use hierarchy through spacing or grouping (e.g., notification bell and notifications history; Teams and Communities)
| Identify where the profile/preferences section is | Low | None | N/A
|===

== Summary of Findings

=== Login / Sign Up Flow
* Cognitive load is already low overall.
* No major usability blockers were identified.
* Improvements mainly relate to visual clarity (focus states) and system responsiveness (loading indicators), which help reduce uncertainty during interactions.

=== Tournament Creation
* This flow introduces higher cognitive load, mostly due to incomplete or overly generic inputs.
* The tournament form requires users to interpret generic categories without contextual help.
* Missing input fields, like region, force the user to pause, think, and later return to editing.
* These gaps increase mental effort because the user needs to infer missing logic or guess what the system expects.

=== Navigation Bar
* Navigation is generally lightweight with minimal cognitive demand.
* Lack of hierarchy among categories requires users to scan more than necessary (e.g., communities vs. teams look equally important).
* Because profile/preferences placement is intuitive and visible, no issues were found — reducing recognition load.

Overall, cognitive load issues appear mainly in form-heavy or decision-heavy flows (*Tournament Creation*), while navigation and login remain low-load experiences with minor polish needed.

== Proposed Design Improvements

=== For Login / Sign Up
* Add input focus color states — helps users visually anchor which field they are interacting with.
* Introduce loading states — reduces uncertainty when waiting for account creation or preference fetching.
* Tooltip for password visibility icon — enhances clarity for less familiar users.

=== For Tournament Creation
* Implement game-specific tournament type presets — avoids forcing users to interpret generic categories and reduces reasoning load.
* Add missing region selection field — ensures completeness of the form and reduces back-and-forth revisiting.
* Provide a lightweight "Saved ✓" confirmation — gives immediate system feedback and reduces user doubt about progress.

=== For Navigation Bar
* Introduce visual hierarchy through spacing and grouping — helps users quickly understand which sections relate to each other, reducing scanning effort.
* Refine categories like Notifications and Teams — example: grouping Teams + Communities, Notifications + Notification History.
* Because the profile/preferences entry point works well, no changes are recommended there.
