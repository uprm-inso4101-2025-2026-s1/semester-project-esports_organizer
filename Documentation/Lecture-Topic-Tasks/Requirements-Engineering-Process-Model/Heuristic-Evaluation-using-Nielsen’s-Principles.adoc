= Heuristic Evaluation using Nielsen’s Principles for Esports Organizer

== Introduction
Heuristic Evaluation is a usability inspection method introduced by Jakob Nielsen to identify interface design issues based on a set of 10 usability heuristics.

These heuristics act as general principles for good user interface design, helping developers detect usability problems early without the need for user testing.

The purpose of this evaluation is to analyze the *Esports Organizer* interface, focusing on the main pages such as *Login*, *Home*, and *Tournament*, and assessing their compliance with Nielsen’s principles.

This process supports the *Verification and Validation* phase in the Software Engineering Lifecycle, ensuring that usability requirements and human-system interactions meet expected quality standards.

== Methodology
The evaluation followed Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics:

. Visibility of system status
. Match between system and the real world
. User control and freedom
. Consistency and standards
. Error prevention
. Recognition rather than recall
. Flexibility and efficiency of use
. Aesthetic and minimalist design
. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
. Help and documentation

Each heuristic was analyzed based on the *Esports Organizer* user interface. Observations were made on whether the design fully complies, partially complies, or fails to meet the heuristic. For each issue identified, a recommendation for improvement was proposed.

|===
| # | Heuristic | Observation | Evaluation | Recommendation

| 1 | Visibility of system status | The login form provides loading feedback when submitting, but tournament creation lacks progress indication. | Partial | Add progress bars or status messages when creating or joining tournaments.

| 2 | Match between system and real world | Icons for "Teams" and "Events" are intuitive but lack descriptive text for new users. | Partial | Include short labels or tooltips to clarify icon meanings.

| 3 | User control and freedom | Once a tournament is created, there is no visible “Cancel” or “Undo” option. | Fail | Add cancel/edit functionality to reduce user frustration.

| 4 | Consistency and standards | Button styles and colors are consistent across pages, maintaining a cohesive theme. | Pass | Maintain visual consistency as new pages are added.

| 5 | Error prevention | Form validation prevents empty submissions but lacks inline messages for format errors (e.g., invalid email). | Partial | Provide real-time validation with hints.

| 6 | Recognition rather than recall | The navigation bar uses clear labels that minimize memory load. | Pass | Continue using recognizable terms instead of abstract icons.

| 7 | Flexibility and efficiency of use | Shortcuts or quick actions for frequent users (e.g., “Create new tournament” button on dashboard). | Pass | Continue adding quick access options when possible.

| 8 | Aesthetic and minimalist design | The color palette and spacing create a clean visual hierarchy. | Pass | Avoid adding unnecessary elements that may clutter the UI.

| 9 | Help users recover from errors | Login errors display “Invalid credentials”. | Pass | Continue displaying error messages in forms and other areas of the platform.

| 10 | Help and documentation | Help Section present. | Partial | Add more FAQ and common tips for first-time users.

== Discussion
The evaluation reveals that *Esports Organizer* already demonstrates good usability foundations in terms of visual consistency, layout clarity, and aesthetic design.

However, areas such as error handling, feedback clarity, and flexibility still need refinement to fully meet Nielsen’s heuristics.

Improving status visibility, adding contextual help, and providing more detailed feedback messages would significantly enhance the system’s usability, reduce user confusion, and align the interface with *Requirements Validation* goals.

== Conclusion
Through Nielsen’s Heuristic Evaluation, it becomes clear that small inconsistencies and lack of clear feedback can increase user effort and reduce satisfaction.

Applying the recommended improvements will not only make *Esports Organizer* more user-friendly but will also ensure that the design aligns with established software engineering principles and provides a seamless user experience.
