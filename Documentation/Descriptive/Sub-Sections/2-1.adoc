== 2 Descriptive Part

=== 2.1 Domain Description

[.hl-yellow]#This section describes the essential components and interactions that exist in the real-world domain of esports tournaments. It focuses on how players, teams, organizers, and communities participate in competitive events: how teams are formed, how tournaments are announced, how matches are scheduled and played, and how results affect rankings and future competitions.#

[.hl-green]#The description is organized into several parts. The rough sketch captures informal, everyday statements from people involved in esports, showing how they naturally talk about tournaments, rosters, formats, and schedules. The terminology section then abstracts these observations into stable domain concepts and names. The narrative describes a typical tournament lifecycle, from announcement and registration to bracket progression and closure of the event.#

[.hl-yellow]#Finally, the sections on events, actions, behaviors, and function signatures structure the dynamic phenomena of the domain. They identify what happens (events), what people or organizers deliberately do (actions), how multi-step flows unfold over time (behaviors), and how these phenomena can be expressed as abstract operations over domain concepts. Together, these views provide a coherent description of the esports tournament domain that later requirements and designs can trace back to.#


=== 2.1.1 Rough Sketch
- [.hl-red]#Players register in a community and can either create new teams or join existing ones advertised within the platform.#

- [.hl-red]#Each team designates a captain, who manages invitations, roster changes, and tournament registrations.#

- [.hl-red]#Organizers publish tournament announcements with eligibility rules such as age limits, roster size, or regional restrictions.#

- [.hl-red]#Teams submit their rosters before the registration deadline, depending on the ruleset, limited roster chances may be permitted later.#

- [.hl-red]#Tournament seeding is determined by prior rankings, past results, or qualifiers.#

- [.hl-red]#Supported formats include single-elimination, double-elimination, Swiss, or round-robin.#

- [.hl-red]#Teams must check in before each match; missing a grace period may cause a forfeit.#

- [.hl-red]#Results are recorded; tiebreakers decide standings in round-robins or Swiss.#

- [.hl-red]#Spectators and media follow brackets, standings, and schedules.#

[.hl-green]#The following are statements people would say in their day to day life.#

- [.hl-yellow]#"Hey Carlos, I just wanted to say that im very glad I met you at the last tournament. I had a really difficutl time making friends and always wanted to be part of a community that enjoyed the same games as I do. Ever since joining the Smash Bros community here, Ive made a lot of good friends like you and have had a great time participating in events with them."#

- [.hl-yellow]#"Hey Fabian, Ive been playing Super Smash Bros day and night but dont have anyone to play against. I was thinking of organizing an event in a neat manner where I can find suitable opponents and make a fun competition for everyone. Would you be interested in helping me set it up?"#

- [.hl-yellow]#"What are we gonna do guys? We need one more member to complete the roster qualifications if we want to compete in the UPRM Marvel Rivals tournament in May. We need to make sure our team is registered two weeks before the tournament too. Any ideas on who we can invite to join us?"#

- [.hl-yellow]#"Alright people if we're seriours about forming our esports team we need to decide on a captain. This person will be in charge of inviting people, updating the roster and signing us up to tournaments. I think Tomas would be a great choice since he's organized and knows a lot about the games we play. What do you guys think?"#

- [.hl-yellow]#"Hi Maria, have you seen the requirements posted on the site for the Mario Kart Tournament in February? The organizers stated that you have to be older than 13. They also mentioned that teams need to have 4 members and only people from the west side of the island can enter this specific tournament. Would you be interested in participating with me? Im looking for people from campus that live around here like me in order to be able to form my team."#

- [.hl-yellow]#"Hi are you one of the organizers for the tournament? I just wanted to say that I noticed how you didnt just put teams randomly in a bracket; instead it seems that teams where seeded based on how well they did in previous tournaments or online qualifiers. I think that was a great idea since I could see and experience first-hand how it made the competition more balanced and fair for everyone."#

- [.hl-yellow]#"Oh hi Gabriela! Sorry I havent been able to go out with you much this month. Ive been really busy competing on events around the island. Its been fun to play in events with different formats. Some are single elimination so you lose once you're out. Others are double elimination, round robin or that Swiss system where you keep playing people with similar records. Although I've been busy with the torunaments and school work I've had a grat time and have met a lot of people passionate about the same games as me."#

- [.hl-yellow]#"Hey team, just a reminder that we have a match coming up this Saturday at 3 PM. Make sure to check in on the website at least 15 minutes before the match starts. If we dont check in within the grace period, our team will automatically forfeit the match. Let's make sure we're all on time and ready to play!"#

- [.hl-yellow]#"Bro, last night's match was insane! Since after every match  score were reported you could see how close each team was to winning. I remember in a round robin tournament two teams ended with the same number of wins, so they had to use things like head-to-head results or point differences to decide who placed higher. It made every point count, and it was so exciting to watch!"#

- [.hl-yellow]#"The popularity the esports community is gaining is surprising. Even people who aren’t playing still follow everything. I heard on reddit that some people keep checking the brackets, match schedules, and standings to see who is winning and who got knocked out. Some even stream or share updates on Instagram and Facebook. Yesterday I even heard my grandma talk about how some kid won a five thousand dollar price on Fortnite tournament in Alabama. It's amazing to see how much interest there is in esports nowadays!"#

Figure 2.1.1 - Tournament and community interaction flow

[.hl-yellow]#This diagram illustrates the relationship between players, organizers, and communities. In this diagram:#

- [.hl-yellow]#**Blue rectangles** represent entities (players, teams, organizers, communities).#

- [.hl-yellow]#**Red diamonds** represent actions (register, create, update, check-in, etc.).#

- [.hl-yellow]#**Arrows** indicate the flow of interactions or dependencies between entities and actions.#

[.hl-yellow]#If you want to focus on entities, a class diagram could be used, with relations labeled by the actions they enable. Since this is not a standard UML diagram, the graphical elements are explained above for clarity.#

=== 2.1.2 Terminology

[.hl-yellow]#This section defines key domain concepts observed in esports tournaments. These terms originate from the real-world phenomena described in the rough sketch and serve as stable abstractions used consistently throughout requirements, design, and validation.# 

[.hl-yellow]#Each term emphasizes what exists or happens in the esports domain itself, without referencing interfaces or technical system behavior.# 

- [.hl-yellow]#Player: An individual who participates in competitive gaming events, forms part of a community, and may join or create teams.#  

- [.hl-yellow]#Team: A coordinated group of players who share a name, identity, and roster. Teams participate in tournaments and may designate a captain to manage administrative responsibilities.#  

- [.hl-green]#Captain: A team member who takes on leadership tasks such as inviting players, organizing the roster, communicating with organizers, and handling registration-related responsibilities.#  

- [.hl-yellow]#Organizer: A person or group that plans, schedules, and manages esports tournaments, defines eligibility rules, determines formats, and oversees match progression.#  

- [.hl-yellow]#Tournament: A structured competitive event in which teams face one another according to a defined format (e.g., single elimination, double elimination, Swiss, round robin).# 

image::Result_Report_Flowchart.JPG[align=center]

[.hl-green]#Figure Result Report Interaction Flow.
This diagram illustrates the flow of the result report creation process.#  

- [.hl-green]#**Blue rectangles** represent actions (Create array, trow error, etc).
- **Purple diamonds** represent questions (Is the data empty?, Are there more teams to import.).
- **Arrows** indicate the flow of interactions.#

- [.hl-green]#*Tournament Data*: Data on the tournamnets, final standing, KDA etc. used to create the final ranking list.
- *Ranking array*: Final ranking list. every team is placed on the order of where they finished on the ladder.#

- [.hl-yellow]#Match: A competitive encounter between two teams within a tournament, whose outcome contributes to bracket progress, standings, or ranking calculations.#  

- [.hl-green]#Bracket: The competitive structure that represents match pairings, progression paths, and advancement rules across the tournament’s stages.#  

- [.hl-yellow]#Spectator: An individual who follows tournament progress, standings, schedules, or match outcomes, regardless of whether they actively compete.#  

- [.hl-yellow]#Community: A social group of players and teams who share common interests, participate in events, and interact across local or online competitive environments.#  

- [.hl-green]#Stage: A recognizable phase in the lifecycle of a tournament, such as announcement, registration, seeding, match progression, and finalization. Each stage has its own domain rules, deadlines, and phenomena that affect how teams advance or prepare for competition.#


[.hl-green]#These terms establish conceptual stability across the documentation, ensuring that later requirements and designs reference the same domain meanings introduced here.# 

=== 2.1.3 Relationship Between Rough Sketch and Terminology

[.hl-yellow]#The Rough Sketch captures informal, everyday statements from players, friends, and organizers, showing how people naturally describe tournaments, rosters, deadlines, formats, and eligibility in real-life esports communities. These unstructured observations reveal the raw phenomena of the domain: who acts, what happens, and what constraints exist.#  

[.hl-yellow]#The Terminology section formalizes these raw observations into stable domain concepts. Each term provides a precise name for a recurring idea that appears throughout the Rough Sketch but is expressed informally in different ways.#  

[.hl-green]#For example, participants talk about “checking in 15 minutes before the match” or “missing the grace period and forfeiting.” These conversational descriptions are abstracted into the concept of a Check-In Policy, which defines expectations and outcomes around attendance before match start times.#  

[.hl-yellow]#Statements about “needing four players,” “finding a fifth teammate,” or “only players from the west side can join” correspond to domain-level Eligibility Constraints and Roster Composition Rules.#  

[.hl-green]#Mentions of previous results, qualifiers, or balanced brackets are abstracted into Seeding Criteria, a domain concept describing how teams are ordered before competition begins.#  

[.hl-yellow]#When players discuss single elimination, double elimination, round robin, or Swiss formats, the terminology identifies these as elements of Tournament Format Specification, a stable concept describing the structural logic of competition.#  

[.hl-green]#Even casual comments about spectators “checking brackets,” “following standings,” or “watching streams” reflect the presence of Spectator Engagement, which the terminology formalizes as a domain concept capturing non-player participation.#  

[.hl-yellow]#This abstraction process ensures consistency and closure across the documentation: every informal phenomenon described in the Rough Sketch maps cleanly to a concept in the Terminology section, which will later align with requirements, design models, and function signatures.#


=== 2.1.4 Expanded Narrative

[.hl-yellow]#The esports tournament domain is structured around several key concepts: tournaments, teams, matches, organizers, communities, and stages. A **stage** is a phase in the tournament lifecycle (e.g., registration, bracket generation, match play, results update, closure). Each stage has its own rules, actions, and transitions.#

* [.hl-red]#For single-elimination tournaments, the bracket is structured as a balanced binary tree, ensuring fair seeding based on rank or random assignment.#

[.hl-green]#The process begins with an organizer announcing a tournament, specifying its format, rules, and registration window. Players form teams, designate captains, and register for the event. During the registration stage, eligibility is checked (account status, ranking, roster size). If too many teams register, a waitlist is created. When registration closes, the bracket is generated—often as a binary tree for single-elimination, or other structures for Swiss/round-robin formats. Teams may receive byes if the participant count is not a power of two.#

* [.hl-red]#Teams may receive byes if the total participant count is not a power of two.#

[.hl-green]#As the tournament progresses through its stages, matches are played round by round. Winners advance to the next stage, losers are eliminated. After each match, results are updated, scores are recorded, and tiebreakers may be applied. The final stage is closure, where results are published and rankings updated. Throughout, communities and spectators follow progress, and organizers manage logistics and communications.#

[.hl-yellow]#The narrative covers the full lifecycle, emphasizing how each stage (registration, bracket generation, match play, results, closure) plays a distinct role in the domain. The concept of "stage" is central: it structures the flow, determines available actions, and governs transitions between phases.#


=== 2.1.5 Unified Domain Concepts and Operations

[.hl-yellow]#Entities, actions, events, and behaviors are all phenomena in the esports domain. They are not separated into distinct sections, but are described together to show how they interact and support domain observations.#

- **Entities**: Team, Tournament, Match, Player, Organizer, Community, Stage
- **Actions/Operations**: Create tournament, register team, generate bracket, assign captain, update match result, record forfeit, send notification, perform map veto, check-in team
- **Events**: Registration window closes, match completed, bracket generated, player disconnect, roster update deadline reached
- **Behaviors**: Run tournament flow, handle registration, update bracket progression, manage real-time updates

Each action/operation is paired with its function signature, showing how it expresses domain observations. For example:

* **registerTeam(team, tournament)**: Used when a team registers for a tournament. The function requires a team and a tournament; teams are created by players, tournaments by organizers. If you need a team, use a function like `createTeam(player, name, ...)` (not shown here, but implied by the domain).
* **updateTeamScore(teamID, points)**: Updates a team's score. Points may be produced by match results, so the function should clarify where points come from (e.g., `recordMatchResult` returns points). If you have only a teamID, you may need to resolve it to a team object via the tournament or a lookup function. Alternatively, `updateTeamScore` could take a team object directly, or the Match object could be responsible for updating scores for all teams involved.

These decisions require discussion and negotiation among the project team. For example, should `updateTeamScore` take a teamID or a team object? Should the Match object update scores for all teams? Each approach has tradeoffs and may require changes to the implementation. The function signatures are grouped with their actions/operations to clarify how they support domain scenarios.

=== 2.1.6 Function Signatures (Grouped with Actions)

Function signatures define how operations are represented programmatically, describing inputs, outputs, and failure conditions. They are grouped with their corresponding actions/operations to clarify how they support domain scenarios and observations.

Figure 2.1.4 - Example check in flow

== Model Explanation

[.hl-green]#This Petri net model represents the complete player check-in flow within the Esports Organizer system. 
The goal is to clearly illustrate how a player progresses through the system before a match begins, 
how delays or no-shows are handled, and how different transitions alter a player's state. 
Using a token-based representation makes the flow intuitive and highlights how the system behaves under different scenarios.

The model begins with the player in the *Waiting for Check-In* state. 
A token is placed in this initial place to represent one player who has not yet interacted with the check-in system. 
When the player arrives and performs the check-in action, the transition *Player Arrives* fires, 
moving the token into the *Checked-In* state. This represents the user pressing the "Check-In" button in the interface.

Once the player is in *Checked-In*, they must confirm readiness before the match can begin. 
When the confirmation occurs, the *Confirm Ready* transition fires, moving the token to the *Ready for Match* state. 
This indicates that the player has completed pre-match requirements. In the real system, this corresponds to backend logic updating the player's ready status.

If the player does not check in within the allowed time, the *Timeout Occurs* transition fires, 
sending the token from *Waiting for Check-In* to *No-Show*. 
This is triggered by a countdown or scheduled function. 
Admins may also manually flag a player absent using the *Mark as No-Show* transition, moving the token from *Checked-In* to *No-Show*.

These transitions illustrate how the system handles normal and exceptional flow paths. 
The model ensures that all possible outcomes are explicitly defined—arriving on time, confirming readiness, failing to check in, or being manually marked absent.#

Each function maintains closure within the domain: the output (e.g., a BracketStructure or UpdatedTeam) can directly serve as input to another function in the system, supporting modularity and composability in software design.

Design decisions about function parameters (e.g., using teamID vs. team object, updating scores via Match or Team) should be discussed and negotiated by the project team. Implementation may need to be revised as the domain model evolves.
