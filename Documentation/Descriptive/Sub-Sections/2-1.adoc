== 2 Descriptive Part

=== 2.1 Domain Description

[.hl-yellow]#This section describes the essential components and interactions that exist in the real-world domain of esports tournaments. It focuses on how players, teams, organizers, and communities participate in competitive events: how teams are formed, how tournaments are announced, how matches are scheduled and played, and how results affect rankings and future competitions.#

[.hl-green]#The description is organized into several parts. The rough sketch captures informal, everyday statements from people involved in esports, showing how they naturally talk about tournaments, rosters, formats, and schedules. The terminology section then abstracts these observations into stable domain concepts and names. The narrative describes a typical tournament lifecycle, from announcement and registration to bracket progression and closure of the event.#

[.hl-yellow]#Finally, the sections on events, actions, behaviors, and function signatures structure the dynamic phenomena of the domain. They identify what happens (events), what people or organizers deliberately do (actions), how multi-step flows unfold over time (behaviors), and how these phenomena can be expressed as abstract operations over domain concepts. Together, these views provide a coherent description of the esports tournament domain that later requirements and designs can trace back to.#


=== 2.1.1 Rough Sketch

[.hl-yellow]#The following statements illustrate real conversations and experiences shared within esports communities. They present informal, everyday observations that reveal how players and organizers naturally talk about tournaments, rosters, formats, eligibility, and scheduling. These conversations serve as raw material from which more structured domain concepts are derived.# 

[.hl-green]#"Bro, joining the Smash community at UPRM was honestly one of the best things I've done. I used to struggle finding people to play with, but after that tournament last month I've already made a bunch of friends."#

[.hl-yellow]#"Hey Fabián, I've been grinding Smash every night but barely have anyone to play against. I'm thinking of organizing a small event so people can find opponents and have a good time. Would you want to help me set it up?"#

[.hl-yellow]#"What are we going to do, guys? We're still missing one player to meet the roster requirements for the UPRM Marvel Rivals tournament in May. And we also need to make sure the team is registered at least two weeks before the deadline."#

[.hl-green]#"If we're serious about forming this team, we need to choose a captain. Someone who can keep track of invitations, update the roster, and handle registrations. Honestly, Tomás would be great—he’s organized and knows the scene well."#

[.hl-yellow]#"Maria, did you check the rules for the Mario Kart tournament in February? You need to be older than 13, have a four-player team, and be from the west side of the island. Want to team up with me?"#

[.hl-green]#"Hey, are you one of the organizers? I noticed you didn’t just place teams randomly—you actually used previous results and qualifiers to seed the bracket. It felt a lot more balanced that way."#

[.hl-green]#"I've been traveling to events all month. Some are single elimination, others double elimination, round robin, and even Swiss. It's tiring but honestly really fun experiencing all the different formats."#

[.hl-yellow]#"Reminder, team: our match on Saturday is at 3 PM. Make sure to check in at least 15 minutes before or we automatically forfeit. Don’t be late."#

[.hl-yellow]#"Bro, last night’s match was wild. After every match, the scores updated instantly and you could see the standings shift. Two teams tied in that round robin, so they had to use point differential and head-to-head as tiebreakers."#

[.hl-green]#"It’s crazy how big esports has gotten. Even people who don’t play still follow brackets, schedules, and standings. Some post updates on Instagram or stream the matches. My grandma told me some kid won five thousand dollars in a Fortnite event the other day."#

[.hl-yellow]#The following diagram shows how players, communities, and tournament processes commonly interact in competitive environments.#

This diagram illustrates the relationship between players, organizers, and communities. It shows how tournaments are advertised, how teams are formed and registered, and how interactions move from creation to competition within the ecosystem.

=== 2.1.2 Terminology

[.hl-yellow]#This section defines key domain concepts observed in esports tournaments. These terms originate from the real-world phenomena described in the rough sketch and serve as stable abstractions used consistently throughout requirements, design, and validation.# 

[.hl-yellow]#Each term emphasizes what exists or happens in the esports domain itself, without referencing interfaces or technical system behavior.# 

- [.hl-yellow]#Player: An individual who participates in competitive gaming events, forms part of a community, and may join or create teams.#  

- [.hl-yellow]#Team: A coordinated group of players who share a name, identity, and roster. Teams participate in tournaments and may designate a captain to manage administrative responsibilities.#  

- [.hl-green]#Captain: A team member who takes on leadership tasks such as inviting players, organizing the roster, communicating with organizers, and handling registration-related responsibilities.#  

- [.hl-yellow]#Organizer: A person or group that plans, schedules, and manages esports tournaments, defines eligibility rules, determines formats, and oversees match progression.#  

- [.hl-yellow]#Tournament: A structured competitive event in which teams face one another according to a defined format (e.g., single elimination, double elimination, Swiss, round robin).#  

- [.hl-yellow]#Match: A competitive encounter between two teams within a tournament, whose outcome contributes to bracket progress, standings, or ranking calculations.#  

- [.hl-green]#Bracket: The competitive structure that represents match pairings, progression paths, and advancement rules across the tournament’s stages.#  

- [.hl-yellow]#Spectator: An individual who follows tournament progress, standings, schedules, or match outcomes, regardless of whether they actively compete.#  

- [.hl-yellow]#Community: A social group of players and teams who share common interests, participate in events, and interact across local or online competitive environments.#  

- [.hl-green]#Stage: A recognizable phase in the lifecycle of a tournament, such as announcement, registration, seeding, match progression, and finalization. Each stage has its own domain rules, deadlines, and phenomena that affect how teams advance or prepare for competition.#


[.hl-green]#These terms establish conceptual stability across the documentation, ensuring that later requirements and designs reference the same domain meanings introduced here.# 

=== 2.1.3 Relationship Between Rough Sketch and Terminology

[.hl-yellow]#The Rough Sketch captures informal, everyday statements from players, friends, and organizers, showing how people naturally describe tournaments, rosters, deadlines, formats, and eligibility in real-life esports communities. These unstructured observations reveal the raw phenomena of the domain: who acts, what happens, and what constraints exist.#  

[.hl-yellow]#The Terminology section formalizes these raw observations into stable domain concepts. Each term provides a precise name for a recurring idea that appears throughout the Rough Sketch but is expressed informally in different ways.#  

[.hl-green]#For example, participants talk about “checking in 15 minutes before the match” or “missing the grace period and forfeiting.” These conversational descriptions are abstracted into the concept of a Check-In Policy, which defines expectations and outcomes around attendance before match start times.#  

[.hl-yellow]#Statements about “needing four players,” “finding a fifth teammate,” or “only players from the west side can join” correspond to domain-level Eligibility Constraints and Roster Composition Rules.#  

[.hl-green]#Mentions of previous results, qualifiers, or balanced brackets are abstracted into Seeding Criteria, a domain concept describing how teams are ordered before competition begins.#  

[.hl-yellow]#When players discuss single elimination, double elimination, round robin, or Swiss formats, the terminology identifies these as elements of Tournament Format Specification, a stable concept describing the structural logic of competition.#  

[.hl-green]#Even casual comments about spectators “checking brackets,” “following standings,” or “watching streams” reflect the presence of Spectator Engagement, which the terminology formalizes as a domain concept capturing non-player participation.#  

[.hl-yellow]#This abstraction process ensures consistency and closure across the documentation: every informal phenomenon described in the Rough Sketch maps cleanly to a concept in the Terminology section, which will later align with requirements, design models, and function signatures.#  

=== 2.1.4 Narrative

=== 2.1.4 Narrative

[.hl-yellow]#Esports tournaments typically begin when an organizer announces an event and shares details such as the game title, ruleset, eligible regions, roster requirements, and the registration window. Communities spread the word, and players decide whether to form new teams or join existing ones in order to participate.#  

[.hl-yellow]#During the registration period, teams finalize their rosters and designate a captain who handles communication and administrative decisions. Organizers verify eligibility constraints—such as age, region, or roster size—and may place additional teams on a waitlist when registration exceeds capacity.#  

[.hl-green]#Once registration closes, the competition moves into what participants commonly describe as the “setup phase” of the event. This phase includes applying seeding criteria—often based on prior results, rankings, or qualifier performance—and preparing the bracket structure according to the chosen tournament format (single elimination, double elimination, round robin, or Swiss). Some teams may receive byes when the number of participants does not fill the bracket evenly.#  

[.hl-yellow]#As the tournament progresses, matches are played round-by-round according to the structure of the bracket or format. After each match, results are confirmed and used to determine standings, bracket advancement, or tiebreaker resolution when teams hold identical records.#  

[.hl-green]#Throughout the competition, players and spectators follow schedules, upcoming matchups, and bracket changes, especially during high-stakes rounds where advancement depends on a single match outcome. Policies such as check-in windows and forfeits also shape how teams prepare before each match.#  

[.hl-yellow]#The event concludes once the final match is played and a winner is determined. Final results contribute to future seeding, community reputation, and discussions among players. This narrative reflects the full lifecycle of an esports competition as observed in real communities—from early preparation, through competitive play, to final closure.#  


=== 2.1.5 Concepts Involving Events, Actions, Behaviors

[.hl-yellow]#Events, actions, and behaviors represent dynamic phenomena in the esports tournament domain. They describe what happens, what people deliberately do, and how multi-step processes unfold over time. These concepts arise naturally from the real-life situations described in the Rough Sketch and form the operational backbone of competitive events.#  

[.hl-yellow]#An event is an instantaneous change in state. An action is a deliberate act performed by a participant (e.g., player, captain, organizer). A behavior is a multi-step flow composed of multiple actions and events.#  

== Events (Instantaneous State Changes)

- [.hl-yellow]#*Registration Window Closes* — At the deadline, no further teams may join the event.#  
- [.hl-yellow]#*Roster Deadline Reached* — After this moment, teams may no longer make substitutions unless rules permit limited changes.#  
- [.hl-green]#*Team Check-In Timeout* — A team fails to check in within the grace period and is marked as forfeited.#  
- [.hl-green]#*Tournament Seeding Finalized* — Rankings, past results, or qualifier outcomes are locked into the initial bracket.#  
- [.hl-yellow]#*Match Result Recorded (e.g., 2–1)* — The outcome triggers bracket advancement or round-robin standings updates.#  
- [.hl-green]#*Tiebreaker Triggered* — Round-robin or Swiss ties activate criteria such as point differential or head-to-head results.#  

== Actions (Deliberate Domain Acts)

- [.hl-yellow]#*Create Tournament* — An organizer defines the ruleset, eligibility constraints, and schedule.#  
- [.hl-yellow]#*Register Team* — The captain submits required roster and region details to enter the competition.#  
- [.hl-green]#*Submit Roster* — Teams provide a finalized lineup before the deadline.#  
- [.hl-green]#*Assign Captain* — Players designate a leader responsible for invitations and roster management.#  
- [.hl-yellow]#*Generate Seeding / Bracket* — Organizers determine placements using rankings, qualifiers, or randomization.#  
- [.hl-yellow]#*Record Match Result* — Officials or captains report scores that update standings or bracket progression.#  
- [.hl-green]#*Perform Map Veto / Match Preparation* — In certain games, teams remove or select maps before starting a match.#  
- [.hl-yellow]#*Send Notifications or Announcements* — Organizers communicate schedule updates or match calls.#  

== Behaviors (Multi-Step, Structured Processes)

- [.hl-yellow]#*Tournament Lifecycle:* Announcement → Registration → Seeding → Match Play → Result Updates → Closure.#  
- [.hl-green]#*Registration Flow:* Check eligibility → Validate roster size → Confirm or waitlist team → Lock roster at deadline.#  
- [.hl-yellow]#*Bracket Progression:* Identify match → Update score → Determine winner → Advance to next round or apply elimination.#  
- [.hl-green]#*Check-In Procedure:* Notify teams → Await attendance → Apply grace period → Trigger timeout or forfeit event.#  
- [.hl-yellow]#*Tiebreaker Evaluation:* Compare tied teams → Apply head-to-head → Apply point differential → Determine final placement.#  

[.hl-green]#Together, these events, actions, and behaviors provide a structured representation of how esports tournaments unfold in practice. They connect informal observations from the Rough Sketch with operational concepts that later requirements, design artifacts, and function signatures depend on.#  

=== 2.1.6 Function Signatures

[.hl-yellow]#Function signatures represent abstract operations over domain concepts. Each signature corresponds directly to an action identified in Section 2.1.5 and describes how entities transform or relate as a result of that action.#  

[.hl-yellow]#These signatures do not describe a technical API; rather, they formalize domain-level transitions such as registering a team, generating a bracket, or recording a match result.#  

== Actions and Their Abstract Function Signatures

=== Create Tournament
- [.hl-yellow]#*createTournament(organizer, name, format, maxSlots, rules)* → Tournament \| Failure#  
[.hl-green]#Creates a tournament entity using the parameters defined by the organizer. Failure may occur if constraints are violated (e.g., invalid ruleset).#

=== Register Team
- [.hl-yellow]#*registerTeam(team, tournament)* → Confirmation \| Waitlist \| Denied#  
[.hl-yellow]#Evaluates eligibility constraints, roster size rules, and available slots. Produces a confirmation outcome or waitlist placement.#

=== Submit Roster
- [.hl-green]#*submitRoster(teamID, playerList, tournamentID)* → RosterSubmitted \| Failure#  
[.hl-green]#Formalizes the act of submitting a complete roster before the roster deadline.#

=== Generate Seeding / Create Bracket
- [.hl-yellow]#*generateBrackets(tournament)* → BracketStructure \| Failure#  
[.hl-yellow]#Establishes match pairings using seeding criteria such as prior rankings, qualifiers, or randomized placement.#

=== Record Match Result
- [.hl-yellow]#*recordMatchResult(matchID, winnerID, score)* → UpdatedBracket \| Failure#  
[.hl-yellow]#Applies the result of a match, advancing the winner and updating standings or bracket progression accordingly.#  

=== Update Team Score / Ranking
- [.hl-yellow]#*updateTeamScore(teamID, points)* → UpdatedTeam \| Failure#  
[.hl-green]#Represents ranking or point adjustments after events such as match wins, stage placement, or tiebreaker outcomes.#  

=== Check-In Procedure
- [.hl-yellow]#*checkInTeam(teamID, tournamentID)* → StatusUpdated \| Timeout#  
[.hl-yellow]#Determines attendance before a match and triggers a timeout event if the team exceeds the grace period.#  

== Closure and Domain Alignment

[.hl-green]#The outputs of these functions (e.g., BracketStructure, UpdatedBracket, StatusUpdated) are themselves domain concepts that serve as inputs for later operations. This ensures closure: every abstract transition remains within the boundaries of the domain and preserves conceptual consistency across requirements and design.#
