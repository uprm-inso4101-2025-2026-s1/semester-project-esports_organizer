== 2 Descriptive Part

=== 2.1 Domain Description
This section describes the essential components and interactions within an the esports tournament platform. It defines how players, teams, and organizers interact through the platform and identifies the terminology and conceptual abstractions that structure the system. The description includes a rough sketch of the domain, key terms, a narrative of typical processes, and breakdowns of events, actions, behaviors, and function signatures.

=== 2.1.1 Rough Sketch
•⁠  ⁠[.hl-red]#Players register in a community and can either create new teams or join existing ones advertised within the platform.#
•⁠  ⁠[.hl-red]#Each team designates a captain, who manages invitations, roster changes, and tournament registrations.#
•⁠  ⁠[.hl-red]#Organizers publish tournament announcements with eligibility rules such as age limits, roster size, or regional restrictions.#
•⁠  ⁠[.hl-red]#Teams submit their rosters before the registration deadline, depending on the ruleset, limited roster chances may be permitted later.#
•⁠  ⁠[.hl-red]#Tournament seeding is determined by prior rankings, past results, or qualifiers.#
•⁠  ⁠[.hl-red]#Supported formats include single-elimination, double-elimination, Swiss, or round-robin.#
•⁠  ⁠[.hl-red]#Teams must check in before each match; missing a grace period may cause a forfeit.#
•⁠  ⁠[.hl-red]#Results are recorded; tiebreakers decide standings in round-robins or Swiss.#
•⁠  ⁠[.hl-red]#Spectators and media follow brackets, standings, and schedules.#

[.hl-green]#The following are statements people would say in their day to day life.#

•⁠  ⁠[.hl-yellow]#"Hey Carlos, I just wanted to say that im very glad I met you at the last tournament. I had a really difficutl time making friends and always wanted to be part of a community that enjoyed the same games as I do. Ever since joining the Smash Bros community here, Ive made a lot of good friends like you and have had a great time participating in events with them."#

•⁠  ⁠[.hl-yellow]#"Hey Fabian, Ive been playing Super Smash Bros day and night but dont have anyone to play against. I was thinking of organizing an event in a neat manner where I can find suitable opponents and make a fun competition for everyone. Would you be interested in helping me set it up?"#

•⁠  ⁠[.hl-yellow]#"What are we gonna do guys? We need one more member to complete the roster qualifications if we want to compete in the UPRM Marvel Rivals tournament in May. We need to make sure our team is registered two weeks before the tournament too. Any ideas on who we can invite to join us?"#

•⁠  ⁠[.hl-yellow]#"Alright people if we're seriours about forming our esports team we need to decide on a captain. This person will be in charge of inviting people, updating the roster and signing us up to tournaments. I think Tomas would be a great choice since he's organized and knows a lot about the games we play. What do you guys think?"#

•⁠  ⁠[.hl-yellow]#"Hi Maria, have you seen the requirements posted on the site for the Mario Kart Tournament in February? The organizers stated that you have to be older than 13. They also mentioned that teams need to have 4 members and only people from the west side of the island can enter this specific tournament. Would you be interested in participating with me? Im looking for people from campus that live around here like me in order to be able to form my team."#

•⁠  ⁠[.hl-yellow]#"Hi are you one of the organizers for the tournament? I just wanted to say that I noticed how you didnt just put teams randomly in a bracket; instead it seems that teams where seeded based on how well they did in previous tournaments or online qualifiers. I think that was a great idea since I could see and experience first-hand how it made the competition more balanced and fair for everyone."#

•⁠  ⁠[.hl-yellow]#"Oh hi Gabriela! Sorry I havent been able to go out with you much this month. Ive been really busy competing on events around the island. Its been fun to play in events with different formats. Some are single elimination so you lose once you're out. Others are double elimination, round robin or that Swiss system where you keep playing people with similar records. Although I've been busy with the torunaments and school work I've had a grat time and have met a lot of people passionate about the same games as me."#

•⁠  ⁠[.hl-yellow]#"Hey team, just a reminder that we have a match coming up this Saturday at 3 PM. Make sure to check in on the website at least 15 minutes before the match starts. If we dont check in within the grace period, our team will automatically forfeit the match. Let's make sure we're all on time and ready to play!"#

•⁠  ⁠[.hl-yellow]#"Bro, last night's match was insane! Since after every match  score were reported you could see how close each team was to winning. I remember in a round robin tournament two teams ended with the same number of wins, so they had to use things like head-to-head results or point differences to decide who placed higher. It made every point count, and it was so exciting to watch!"#

•⁠  ⁠[.hl-yellow]#"The popularity the esports community is gaining is surprising. Even people who aren’t playing still follow everything. I heard on reddit that some people keep checking the brackets, match schedules, and standings to see who is winning and who got knocked out. Some even stream or share updates on Instagram and Facebook. Yesterday I even heard my grandma talk about how some kid won a five thousand dollar price on Fortnite tournament in Alabama. It's amazing to see how much interest there is in esports nowadays!"#

Figure 2.1.1 – Tournament and Community Interaction Flow.
This diagram illustrates the relationship between players, organizers, and communities. It shows how tournaments are advertised, how teams are formed and registered, and how interactions move from creation to competition within the ecosystem.

=== 2.1.2 Terminology
- *Player*: An individual who registers on the platform to participate in esports tournaments.
- *Team*: A structured group of players with shared identity, team name, scorem and confirmation status (isConfirmed), led by a captain.
- *Captain*: A designated team member responsible for managing team activities, including roster changes and tournament registrations.
- *Tournament*: A competitive event where teams compete against each other in a structured format.
- *Match*: A single game or series of games played between two teams within a tournament
- *Organizer*: An individual or group responsible for setting up and managing tournaments.
- *Spectator*: An individual who watches the tournaments and follows the progress of teams and matches.
- *Community*: A group of players and teams that share common interests and participate in tournaments together.

=== 2.1.3 domain terminology in relation to domain rough sketch
[.hl-green]#The Rough Sketch describes the dynamic, real-world actions that occur within the platform, such as “team registration,” “match reporting,” or “roster updates.” These represent domain events and procedural details observed in operation.#

* The Terminology section abstracts these raw observations into reusable, stable concepts. For example:
* “15-minute grace period” → becomes Check-In Policy
* “Missed match due to delay” → becomes Forfeit Event
* “Map veto order” → becomes Match Preparation Protocol
* “Roster changes allowed until Day 1” → becomes Roster Update Policy

[.hl-green]#This abstraction process establishes consistency across the documentation, allowing the same concept (e.g., “check-in”) to be used precisely throughout requirements, design, and implementation. It also enables closure, where each defined concept connects seamlessly to a corresponding function or entity in the system model (e.g., a Team object includes isConfirmed to represent check-in status).#

=== 2.1.4 Narrative

The esports tournament process begins with the organizer, who creates and publishes the tournament on the platform. The organizer defines important parameters such as the tournament name, format, ruleset, and registration window. Once registration opens, teams—created by players within communities—can submit their rosters. Each team must designate a captain, who serves as the primary contact for communications, match coordination, and administrative updates.

[.hl-green]#During the registration phase, eligibility is verified (account status, ranking limits, and roster size). If the number of registered teams exceeds capacity, the extra teams are placed on a waitlist queue. When registration closes, the tournament bracket generation algorithm initializes:#

* [.hl-green]#For single-elimination tournaments, the bracket is structured as a balanced binary tree, ensuring fair seeding based on rank or random assignment.
* Teams may receive byes if the total participant count is not a power of two.#

[.hl-green]#As the event progresses, matches are conducted round by round. Winners advance automatically to the next stage, while losers are eliminated. After every match, results are updated in real time through the system’s front end, using listeners or state updates that propagate score and bracket changes across the platform. Once the final match concludes, the tournament state transitions to “closed,” and the results are recorded for ranking and statistical purposes.#

[.hl-green]#This process represents the complete lifecycle of an esports competition, integrating the behaviors of players, teams, and organizers into a unified flow that the platform supports and tracks programmatically.#

=== 2.1.5 Concepts Involving Events, Actions, Behaviors
[.hl-green]#Events, actions, and behaviors are all concepts within the system, just like entities (e.g., team, tournament, match). They are types of dynamic phenomena/concepts that occur in the esports tournament platform and often trigger or influence one another.#

* [.hl-yellow]#Event (instantaneous state change, often triggering action)#
** [.hl-yellow]#"Team registration window closes: At the exact deadline, the platform marks registration as closed and prevents new teams from joining."#
** [.hl-yellow]#"Match #3 has been completed with a score of 2–1: This event triggers bracket updates and ranking point calculations."#
** [.hl-yellow]#"Tournament bracket successfully generated: Once all eligible teams are confirmed, the system produces the initial bracket. This event makes match schedules visible to teams and spectators."#
** [.hl-yellow]#"Player connection lost during match: The system detects a disconnection and logs it. Depending on tournament rules, it may trigger a pause request or automatic forfeit."#
** [.hl-yellow]#"Roster update deadline reached: After this timestamp, no further roster substitutions".#

* Action (an act carried out once)
** [.hl-green]#Create a tournament: An organizer sets the name, game title, ruleset, schedule and registration deadline.#
** [.hl-yellow]#Register a team: a captain submits the team's name, roster, region, and other required data to participate in a specific tournament.#
** [.hl-green]#Generate tournament bracket: The system arranges matchups based on seeding rules or random assignments and stores them in the tournament data.#
** [.hl-green]#Assign a team captain: A team member is designated as captain; this action updates permissions and allows roster management.#

[.hl-green]#Update match results.#

** Record a forfeit.

** [.hl-green]#Send notification to players.#

** Perform map veto.

* Behavior (multi-step process composed of actions/events)

** [.hl-green]#Run Tournament Flow: Create → Register → Generate Bracket → Conduct Matches → Update Results → Close Tournament.#
** [.hl-green]#Handle Registration: Check eligibility → Validate team → Add to confirmed or waitlist → Confirm participation.#
** [.hl-green]#Update Bracket Progression: Identify match → Update scores → Propagate winners to the next match → Refresh tournament state.
** Manage Real-Time Updates: Listen for database changes → Trigger UI updates → Re-render bracket with new data.#

[.hl-green]#These behavioral groupings form the operational backbone of the esports system. Each process is modeled to support agile and event-driven design principles, ensuring the platform reacts to real-time changes (e.g., new registrations, match completions, or team updates) without manual intervention.#

=== 2.1.6 Function Signatures
[.hl-green]#Function signatures define how the system’s operations are represented programmatically, describing inputs, outputs, and failure conditions. Derived from the registration, bracket generation, and update logic described in the reference file, the following function abstractions represent key behaviors in the tournament system:#

* [.hl-green]#createTournament(organizer, name, format, maxSlots, rules) → Tournament | Failure
Creates a new tournament entry with defined parameters.#
* [.hl-green]#registerTeam(team, tournament) → Confirmation | Waitlist | Denied
Registers a team if it meets eligibility requirements and if slots are available.#
* [.hl-green]#generateBrackets(tournament) → BracketStructure | Failure
Creates a bracket layout based on participant count and format (single/double elimination).#
* [.hl-green]#recordMatchResult(matchID, winnerID, score) → UpdatedBracket | Failure
Updates match data and propagates the winning team to the next round.#
* [.hl-green]#updateTeamScore(teamID, points) → UpdatedTeam | Failure
Adjusts a team’s total score and updates leaderboard standings.#
* [.hl-green]#checkInTeam(teamID, tournamentID) → StatusUpdated | Timeout
Verifies attendance before match start; returns timeout if grace period expires.#

[.hl-green]#Each function maintains closure within the domain: the output (e.g., a BracketStructure or UpdatedTeam) can directly serve as input to another function in the system, supporting modularity and composability in software design.#
