[.hl-green]#Liam, 27, works as a graphic designer and enjoys unwinding and decompressing with friends by playing co-op games like Rocket League and R.E.P.O.—games that let him relax and laugh with his friends. Gaming for him is a social activity, not a competition. He values simplicity and convenience. His work inbox is constantly cluttered with notifications, deadlines, client comments, and requests—something he does not want to replicate when gaming. This is why he prefers to use only one Discord server with his close friend group instead of joining multiple servers he would need to read through, and why he mutes most apps on his phone. He does not want to browse through ten Discord servers just to find a small weekend tournament that might not even interest him and then forces him to fill out an overly complicated registration form. He is motivated by social interactions rather than winning; he wants to have fun with his friends without worrying about long sign-ups or having to go out of his way to find casual events. Liam plays games to decompress, not to deal with more stress. He may join a tournament, but only if the sign-up process is quick and does not involve overly long or tedious forms. A typical day for Liam follows a familiar pattern. He wakes up early, prepares for work, and checks an email inbox already packed with notifications, which adds to his stress. After work, he is mentally exhausted and wants to unwind by playing co-op games with friends. However, sometimes they cannot find any events to join and end up spending their available playtime just searching through several Discord servers and other sites—many of which require lengthy registration processes that feel more like work than fun.#
