== Objective
Apply the *Triptych Model* (Domain Description → Requirements Prescription → Software Design) from the lecture to the **Profiles Module** of the Esports Organizer project.  
This task demonstrates how theory connects to our module’s documentation and implementation process.

== 1. Domain Description
The domain focuses on users and how their profiles interact within the Esports Organizer system.  
Entities, functions, and behaviors define the context before any design or implementation.

=== Entities
- **User / Player** – a registered individual with an account and a profile.  
- **Organizer** – a user role with permission to manage events and verify participants.  
- **Profile** – data container with attributes such as name, stats, achievements, and privacy settings.  
- **Badge / Achievement** – symbolic rewards based on user actions or milestones.  
- **Privacy Setting** – determines visibility of profile sections (public, friends-only, private).

=== Functions
- `updateProfile(User)` – allows users to edit and save profile information.  
- `assignBadge(User, Badge)` – grants achievements automatically when conditions are met.  
- `togglePrivacy(ProfileField)` – modifies access permissions for profile visibility.  
- `viewProfile(UserID)` – retrieves the selected profile for display.

=== Behaviors
- Users edit and view profiles through the web interface.  
- Organizers access player information for tournament validation.  
- Privacy rules dynamically affect who can see each profile field.

== 2. Requirements Prescription
Derived from the domain analysis, these requirements describe what the system must achieve.

=== Functional Requirements
- The system shall allow players to **update profile data** and save it persistently.  
- The system shall **display badges and achievements** linked to user activity.  
- The system shall allow each user to **customize privacy settings** for profile fields.  
- The system shall **verify authentication** before modifying any data.

=== Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Profiles must load within 2 seconds on stable networks.  
- **Security:** Only authenticated users may access or edit their data.  
- **Usability:** Privacy settings must be intuitive and consistent across devices.  
- **Reliability:** Updates should never cause partial or inconsistent saves.

== 3. Software Design
The design defines how requirements are implemented through architectural components.

=== Architecture Overview
- **Frontend (React):** Handles profile editing, badge display, and privacy controls.  
- **Backend (Node.js):** Manages API endpoints for CRUD operations and authentication.  
- **Database (Firestore):** Stores user data, privacy states, and achievement records.

=== Design Mapping
|===
| Requirement | Component | Description
| Update personal info | `/updateProfile` endpoint | Validates input and updates Firestore.
| Badge display | `BadgeComponent.jsx` | Fetches and shows user achievements dynamically.
| Privacy control | `PrivacyService.js` | Manages visibility logic for profile fields.
| Data persistence | Firestore database | Ensures secure, scalable user data storage.
|===

== 4. Reflection
The Triptych model shows that development phases are **iterative mindsets**, not isolated steps.  
In the Profiles module, analyzing entities like *Privacy Setting* refined our requirements to include visibility toggling.  
Design challenges, such as optimizing badge rendering, provided feedback that improved both requirements and the domain model.  
This iterative cycle keeps the design, documentation, and implementation consistent and adaptable.
