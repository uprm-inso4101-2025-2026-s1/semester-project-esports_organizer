=== 2.3 Implementation

The implementation stage translates the requirements described in
Section 2.2 into a working system. While requirements define *what*
the platform must achieve, the implementation details *how* these
goals were realized.

The **software architecture** captures the big picture of the system:
* Main modules include authentication, user profiles, tournament
  management, match reporting, and community management.
* These modules communicate through well defined APIs and shared
  data stored in Firestore.
* A web interface built with React ensures accessibility and
  usability for different types of users like players, organizers,
  communities.

The **software design** explains how each component is realized:
* **Authentication:** Implemented with Firebase Authentication and
  OAuth2 providers such as Google, Discord, and Twitch.
* **User profiles:** Stored in Firestore, including usernames, emails,
  stats, teams, and communities.
* **Tournament management:** Collections store brackets, matches, and
  schedules, enforcing limits on participants like defined in
  Section 2.2.3 Domain Requirements.
* **Match reporting:** Organizers and players update results, which
  automatically update user rankings.
* **Communities and teams:** Users can create or join them, ensuring
  inclusivity and adaptability.

Diagrams and screen mockups complement the text:
* Architecture diagrams highlight module interactions.
* Sequence diagrams show workflows such as user login and event
  creation.
* Figma mockups illustrate how the interface supports usage scenarios.

=== 2.3.1 Selected Fragments of the Implementation

Selected fragments are only included when they clarify explanations
and complement the documentation. By themselves, they are not useful.
For this stage of the project, no fragments are presented since the
system is still under development. Once code and designs are available,
they will be added to illustrate how Section 2.2 requirements are met
in practice.

Best practices followed in this documentation:
* **No screenshots** of code â€” only properly formatted snippets.
* **Scalable images** (SVG, PDF) for diagrams and mockups instead of
  raster images (JPEG, PNG).
* **Fragments included only when they clarify**, never for their own
  sake.
