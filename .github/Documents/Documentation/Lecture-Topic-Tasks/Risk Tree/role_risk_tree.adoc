== Role Management System Risk Tree Explanation

=== Role Management System Risk
This represents the overall risk that the system fails to manage user roles and 
permissions securely or correctly.

=== Unauthorized Access
Occurs when a user gains access they should not have.

==== Weak Authentication
Due to poor password policies, missing multi-factor authentication, or easily 
guessable credentials.

==== Lack of Oversight
Could be due to the absence of audit logs or lack of monitoring of role changes.

=== Insufficient Permission Levels
This happens when permissions are too limited or incorrectly set, preventing 
legitimate user actions.

=== Role Misassignment
Occurs when users are assigned to incorrect roles.
