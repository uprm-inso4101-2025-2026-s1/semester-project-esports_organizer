=== 1.1 Team Members
Our project's team is composed entirely of students participating in the Esports Organizer project. Every team member is directly involved in the development, design, and decision-making processes. 
[.red]*At this stage, we do not have external partners (such as external experts, sponsors, or client organizations). Since the project is academic in nature, it is fully carried out by the student team without additional stakeholders.*

[.yellow]*While the project does not have external clients or sponsors, it still involves several types of stakeholders. Stakeholders include players, organizers, spectators,community members / clubs, developers / team members themselves that have an intereste by the system’s outcomes. Recognizing this distinction helps the team consider diverse perspectives when making design and implementation decisions.*

Roles and responsibilities are distributed among the team members as follows:

- Experience Design Team - Focuses on the user interface and overall user experience of the platform. This includes designing intuitive layouts, ensuring visual appeal, and optimizing how users interact with the system to create a seamless and pleasant experience.
- Identity and Data Systems Team - Manages the backend infrastructure, and the data handling. This team ensures that the system can securely store, process, and retrieve user and event information while maintaining performance and reliability.
- Events and Notifications - Handles functionality related to event management and notifications. This includes handling event creation, scheduling, and ensuring timely notifications and updates are delivered to participants and spectators.
- Player and Teams Profiles Team - Oversees features related to player and team identity within the platform. This includes profile creation, team registration, and ensuring accurate representation of players and teams across tournaments and events.

[.green]*To ensure smooth progress across all teams, we are implementing strong communication channels between them following Agile Development within the project. The Experience Design, Identity and Data Systems, and Event Management teams will hold weekly alignment meetings to minimize dependencies and prevent delays in design or implementation. This collaborative workflow ensures that decisions about data structures, user flows, and system needs are made jointly, maintaining consistency across the project.*
