=== 1.1 Team Members
Our project's team is composed entirely of students participating in the Esports Organizer project. Every team member is directly involved in the development, design, and decision-making processes. At this stage, we do not have external partners (such as external experts, sponsors, or client organizations). Since the project is academic in nature, it is fully carried out by the student team without additional stakeholders.
