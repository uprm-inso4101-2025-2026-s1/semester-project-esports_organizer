== 1.5 Derived Goals
In addition to its main goals of centralizing event discovery, simplifying registration, and strengthening community engagement, the Esports Organizer project also seeks to achieve several secondary goals:

* Promote fair play and inclusivity in all competitive tournaments.
* Increase the visibility of local and student-led esports initiatives.
* Encourage partnerships among various gaming communities.
* Support the learning process and skill development for players and teams.
* Raise consciousness about esports culture and its values.

These derived goals add value beyond the platform's main purpose, helping to strengthen communities, improve collaboration, and build long-term engagement in esports.
