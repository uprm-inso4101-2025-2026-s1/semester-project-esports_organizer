= 1.4 Other activities than just developing a source code  

Our project is not limited to just source code. Behind everything each team did the respective research in order to develop a system that is meaningful and effective for the gaming community, helping resolved problems that affect other platforms. 

== *Domain Engineering*

* Situation: The E-sports and gaming community is broad and diverse, with many different stakeholders (players, organizers, spectators). Without a clear description of the domain, the team risks misunderstanding the environment.

*	Need: Developers require a structured understanding of the domain in order to identify relevant actors, workflows, and challenges.

*	Implementation: Conduct domain research and analysis before implementation.

== *Requirements engineering* 

* Situation: There is no formal list of user needs or expectations for this system.

* Need: Developers need precise requirements to define what functionalities the system must provide.

* Implementation: Gather requirements through research, observation of others platform, and discussions, and translate them into functional and non-functional requirements.

== *Software architecture and component design*

* Situation: Without a defined architecture, the system could become inconsistent or unscalable.

* Need: A structured design that organizes the system into clear components and ensures maintainability.

* Implementation: Define an architecture/workflow that supports tournament management (data team), communication and events, and user access in a modular way.

== *Implementation*

* Current Situation: The functionalities identified in the requirements do not yet exist.

* Need: To build a working system that satisfies the requirements.

* Implementation: Implement the modules incrementally, following good coding practices and version control.

== *Testing*

* Current Situation: Without testing, errors and usability issues may remain hidden.

* Need: To validate correctness, performance, and user experience.

* Idea: Perform unit testing, integration testing, and user testing before deployment

== *Deployment and maintenance*

* Current situation: The system must eventually be made available to real users.

* Need: Ensure the system can be accessed by the intended audience and remain functional over time.

* Idea: Plan deployment (initially in a limited scope, etc, for a student or local gaming community) and establish a process for updates and maintenance.

By addressing these activities alongside source code development, the project ensures a complete and professional software engineering process that increases the chances of success and usability of the final system.
