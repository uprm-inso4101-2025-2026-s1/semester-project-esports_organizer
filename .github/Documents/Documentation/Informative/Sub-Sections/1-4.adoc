=== 1.4 Other activities than just developing source code
Our project is not limited to just source code. Through research, each team worked to ensure the system is meaningful and effective for the gaming community, addressing problems seen in other platforms.

==== Domain Engineering
* Situation: The esports and gaming community is broad and diverse, with many different stakeholders (players, organizers, spectators). Without a clear description of the domain, the team risks misunderstanding the environment.
* Need: Developers require a structured understanding of the domain in order to identify relevant actors, workflows, and challenges.
* Implementation: Conducted research on existing platforms (e.g., Start.gg, Battlefy, Toornament) to understand current solutions.

==== Requirements Engineering
* Situation: There is no formal list of user needs or expectations for this system.
* Need: Developers need precise requirements to define what functionalities the system must provide.
* Implementation: Gather requirements through research, observation of other platforms, and discussions, and translate them into functional and non-functional requirements. Collecting and documenting needs from players, organizers, and communities.

==== Software Architecture and Component Design
* Situation: Without a defined architecture, the system could become inconsistent or unscalable.
* Need: A structured design that organizes the system into clear components and ensures maintainability.
* Implementation: Planning the systemâ€™s structure, including front-end, back-end, and database interactions.

==== Implementation
* Situation: The functionalities identified in the requirements do not yet exist.
* Need: To build a working system that satisfies the requirements.
* Implementation: Setting up the React environment with Vite, researching rendering strategies (CSR, SSR, SSG), and creating UI components.

==== Testing
* Situation: Without testing, errors and usability issues may remain hidden.
* Need: To validate correctness, performance, and user experience.
* Implementation: Planning for future milestones to ensure usability, accessibility, and reliability.

==== Documentation
* Establishing AsciiDoc for documentation as code and summarizing research.

==== Collaboration & Team Organization
* Teams were divided into Experience Design, Communities & Social Features, Events & Notifications, Identity & Data Systems, and Player & Team Profiles. Each team performed initial research, role assignment, and task planning.

By addressing these activities alongside source code development, the project ensures a complete and professional software engineering process that increases the chances of success and usability of the final system.

*The Milestone 1 accomplishments included:*
* Experience Design Team - branding, style guides, Figma mockups, user journeys, and feature page prototypes.
* Communities & Social Features Team, Data Backend Team - React setup, research on JSX, Virtual DOM, props vs. state, localization, and documentation workflow.
* All teams - established project repository, did their corresponding research, GitHub workflows, and cross-team communication for requirements.
