= 1.4 Other activities than just developing a source code  

Our project is not limited to just source code. Behind everything each team did the respective research in order to develop a system that is meaningful and effective for the gaming community, helping resolved problems that affect other platforms. 

== *Domain Engineering*

* Situation: The E-sports and gaming community is broad and diverse, with many different stakeholders (players, organizers, spectators). Without a clear description of the domain, the team risks misunderstanding the environment.

*	Need: Developers require a structured understanding of the domain in order to identify relevant actors, workflows, and challenges.

*	Implementation: Conducted research on existing platforms (e.g., Start.gg, Battlefy, Toornament) to understand current solutions.

== *Requirements engineering* 

* Situation: There is no formal list of user needs or expectations for this system.

* Need: Developers need precise requirements to define what functionalities the system must provide.

* Implementation: Gather requirements through research, observation of others platform, and discussions, and translate them into functional and non-functional requirements. Collecting and documenting needs from players, organizers, and communities.

== *Software architecture and component design*

* Situation: Without a defined architecture, the system could become inconsistent or unscalable.

* Need: A structured design that organizes the system into clear components and ensures maintainability.

* Implementation: Planning the systemâ€™s structure, including front-end, back-end, and database interactions.

== *Implementation*

* Current Situation: The functionalities identified in the requirements do not yet exist.

* Need: To build a working system that satisfies the requirements.

* Implementation: Setting up the React environment with Vite, researching rendering strategies (CSR, SSR, SSG), and creating UI components.

== *Testing*

* Current Situation: Without testing, errors and usability issues may remain hidden.

* Need: To validate correctness, performance, and user experience.

* Idea: Planning for future milestones to ensure usability, accessibility, and reliability.

== *Documentation*

* Establishing AsciiDoc for documentation as code and summarizing research.

== *Collaboration & Team Organization*

* Teams divided into UI/UX, Communities & Social Features, Events & Notifications, Identity & Data Systems, and Player/Team Profiles. Each team performed initial research, role assignment, and task planning.


By addressing these activities alongside source code development, the project ensures a complete and professional software engineering process that increases the chances of success and usability of the final system.

*The Milestone 1 accomplishments included:*

* UI/UX team - branding, style guides, Figma mockups, user journeys, and feature page prototypes.
* Communities & Social Features, Data Backend- React setup, research on JSX, Virtual DOM, props vs. state, localization, and documentation workflow.
* All teams - established project repository, did their corresponding research, GitHub workflows, and cross-team communication for requirements.
