== 1.2 Current situations, needs, ideas
=== Current situation 

Video games are a widely popular form of entertainment where people can either enjoy casual fun with friends or compete in more structured, competitive settings. However, the competitive gaming scene is broad and diverse, which makes it harder for players to navigate.Most of the information about E-sports events is scatted across many platforms and communities, and because preferences in games genres vary widely, a lot of events go unnoticed. This lack of variety prevents player from discovering tournaments, joining them, or join the community of that game. Reducing opportunities for players to connect with others who share similar interests.

=== Needs 

From this situation a few needs were identified.

* Players need a **clear, reliable and centralized** where they can easily discover and register for E-sports events.
* Organizers need a reliable and effective channel to promote their events and reach their audience effectively.
* Communities need more visibility for their events so they can attract new members and maintain engagement. 
* Spectators and fans need an accessible way to follow competitions, track results, and feel part of the event experience.

=== Ideas 

Our project aims to address these needs by implementing the following features: 

*	A centralized events hub where player can browser and discover tournaments by game, date, community. 
* A registration and management system to simplify how participants sign up and how organizers handle teams and brackets.
* A notification and updates feature to keep participants and spectators informed in real time.
* A community-driven interface that allows players to connect with others, share interests, and follow ongoing competitions.

These ideas were designed to reduce fragmentation, improve the visibility of events, and create a stronger and more connected E-sports community.
