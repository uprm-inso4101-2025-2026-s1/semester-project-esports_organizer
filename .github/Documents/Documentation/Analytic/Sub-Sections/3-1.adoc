=== Concept Formation and Analysis

Based on our understanding of the esports domain and the problem space, we identify the following key concepts:

**Game vs Gaming Community:**
*Games* are the software titles (Tekken, Valorant), while *Gaming Communities* are groups of players who compete in specific games within geographic regions. 

**Tournament vs Match:**
*Tournaments* are organized competitive events with multiple participants, while *Matches* are individual competitions between players/teams within tournaments. The bracket reference indicates tournaments contain structured match progressions.

**Geographic Locality:**
Multiple references to "local," "in our city," and "geographic areas" reveal that competitive gaming operates within *Local Competitive Scenes* - geographically-bounded communities where players can feasibly attend in-person events.

**Performance and Rankings:**
The "3rd place" and "ranking across events" statements show that *Competition Results* and *Player Rankings* are important domain concepts that currently exist in fragmented form.

*Individual vs Team Competition:* Some games support both individual and team play (e.g., fighting games typically individual, MOBAs typically team-based). Our domain model must accommodate both.

*Casual vs Competitive Players:* The distinction between someone who "plays games" and someone who "competes in tournaments" is crucial for our domain focus.
