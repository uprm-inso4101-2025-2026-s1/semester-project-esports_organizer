== 3.2 Validation and Verification

=== Validation Strategy

Validation determines whether stakeholders agree with our understanding of the esports domain as we have documented it.

**Domain Concept Validation:**

Present our identified concepts to stakeholders and ask for their agreement:

- Present our concept of *Gaming Community* as "groups of players who compete in specific games within geographic regions" to community members and verify this reflects their experience
- Share our understanding of *Local Competitive Scene* as "geographically-bounded communities where players can feasibly attend in-person events" with tournament organizers and participants

**Domain Understanding Validation:**

Present our domain analysis directly to stakeholders:

- Share our understanding that tournaments contain structured match progressions organized in brackets, and verify this reflects how competitive events actually operate
- Show our understanding that competition results and player rankings currently exist in fragmented form across different platforms, and ask stakeholders if this characterizes their current situation

**Terminology Validation:**

Present our terminology definitions to stakeholders and ask for confirmation:

- Confirm that our definition of *Match* as individual competitions within tournaments aligns with how stakeholders use this term
- Check that our concept boundaries between different domain entities match stakeholder understanding

=== Verification Strategy

All concepts in the domain are used consistently across documentation, requirements, and architecture. Requirements clearly trace back to domain properties, and every property that affects the system generates the right requirements. The software architecture covers all specified requirements without gaps, with components having clear responsibilities. The data model represents all domain concepts without conflicts. Implementation matches the design, with unit tests covering all components and interfaces working as specified. Finally, every requirement has a matching test case, and testing environments reflect the operational conditions defined.

=== Success Criteria

**Validation Success Indicators:**
- Stakeholders recognize their experiences in our domain scenarios and confirm our understanding is accurate
- Stakeholders agree with our concept definitions and the relationships we've identified between domain entities
- When stakeholders suggest modifications, they represent refinements rather than fundamental misunderstandings of the domain

**Verification Success Indicators:**
- All cross-references between project documents are accurate and consistent
- Domain concepts are used consistently across all development phases
- Requirements properly trace to domain properties without gaps or contradictions
- Software architecture adequately addresses all specified requirements without conflicts
