== Overview

The `ResultReport.js` file provides a function to generate the results of a given tournament by processing bracket results and arranging participating teams into an ordered list that provides the placements for each team.

== Purpose

It takes a tournament bracket and processes the match results through the bracket progression system, ultimately generating a ranked list of teams alongside their respective placement (e.g. "1st", "2nd", "3rd"...).

== Dependencies

[source,javascript]
----
import { runBracket } from "./MatchProgression.js";
//The following imports are unused as of writing:
import Tournament from "../database/examples/Tournament.js"; // <1>
import Team from "../database/examples/Teams.js"; // <1>
----
<1> The imports go unused in the current implementation as of writing.

* `runBracket` from `MatchProgression.js` - Used to processes the tournament bracket and returns the final team rankings
* `Tournament` - Tournament class
* `Team` - Team class

== Function: resultreport()

=== Signature

[source,javascript]
----
export function resultReport(tournament)
----

=== Parameters

[cols="1,3,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Description | Type | Required
| `Tournament` | The tournament object containing bracket data | Tournament | Yes
|===

=== Algorithm Description

. Calls `runBracket(Tournament)` to get the final team list in reverse order, index 0 being the loser and n-1 being the winner
. Reverses the list to place champion first, basically champion at index 0 and loser at n-1
. Assigns placement strings ("1st", "2nd", "3rd", etc.) to each team
. Returns array of [placement, team] pairs

=== Return Value

Returns an array of tuples or a double-array where each element contains:
- Placement string (e.g., "1st", "2nd", "3rd")
- Team object

Example return structure:
```
javascript
[
  ["1st", TeamObject],
  ["2nd", TeamObject], 
  ["3rd", TeamObject],
  // ...
]
```

=== Error Handling

The function wraps the main logic in a try-catch block:

* Catches any errors thrown by `runBracket()`
* Re-throws errors with the original message
* Prevents silent failures
