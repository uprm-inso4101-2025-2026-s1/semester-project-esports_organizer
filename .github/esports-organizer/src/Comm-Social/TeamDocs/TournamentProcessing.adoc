= getTournamentData Function Documentation

== Function Signature
[source,javascript]
----
export function getTournamentData(tournament)
----

== Description
This function receives a Tournament object and simulates the entire tournament bracket by calling `runBracket` with the tournament's teams. It returns an object containing the tournament rounds data and the champion.

== Parameters
* `tournament` (Object): A Tournament object containing teams to be used in the bracket simulation

== Returns
* `Object` - An object with the following properties:
** `rounds`: Array of tournament rounds data
** `results`: Array of tournament results
** `champion`: The winning team (last element from results array)

== Error Handling
If an error occurs during simulation, the function returns:
* `rounds`: Empty array
* `champion`: null
* Additionally, the error is logged to the console with the message "Error initialization of tournament:"

== Dependencies
* `runBracket` from "./MatchProgression"

== Example Usage
[source,javascript]
----
const tournament = {
  teams: ["Team A", "Team B", "Team C", "Team D"]
};

const tournamentData = getTournamentData(tournament);
console.log(tournamentData.champion); // Winning team
console.log(tournamentData.rounds);   // All tournament rounds
----

== Implementation Details
1. The function wraps the bracket simulation in a try-catch block for error handling
2. Calls `runBracket(tournament.teams)` to simulate the tournament
3. Extracts rounds from `simulation.rounds`
4. Determines champion from the last element of `simulation.results`
5. Returns an object containing rounds, results, and champion properties

== Notes
* The function assumes `runBracket` returns an object with `rounds` and `results` properties
* The champion is identified as the last element in the results array
* In case of error, only `rounds` and `champion` are returned (not `results`)
