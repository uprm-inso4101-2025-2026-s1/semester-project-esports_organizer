== Key Features Validated

=== Core Initialization
* Successful creation of Team instances with required properties
* Organizer automatically added to members array
* Default values applied (rankScore: 0, maxRankScore: 100)
* Constructor respects custom member arrays
* All initialization fields validated (name, organizer, teamRank, maxMembers)

=== Property Access
* All class properties are readable and hold correct values
* Members array is initialized and accessible
* Rank properties behave correctly
* Configuration values (e.g., maxMembers) are preserved

=== Ranking System
* Rank score increases correctly
* Rank does not change until threshold is exceeded
* Rank increments appropriately when passing maxRankScore
* RankScore resets after rank-up
* Zero-score increments have no side effects

=== Edge Case Handling
* Minimal constructor parameters work
* Zero-rank-increase operations behave as expected
* Default values remain stable under edge cases



== Front-End Testing Results:

=== Tests Passed:
* Teams Page Exists
* Teams Page Search Bar is functional
* Back to teams button functions properly.

=== TESTS FAILED:
* Edit Team Profile not save updates.
* Log Result Button unresponsive when pressed
* Manage Roster does not save updates.
* Edit Team Member does not save updates.
* Create new team does not save updates.


=== Conclusion:
In the back-end, all tests passed successfully with a 100% success rate. 
In the front-end, there are issues still in the need of fixing.
