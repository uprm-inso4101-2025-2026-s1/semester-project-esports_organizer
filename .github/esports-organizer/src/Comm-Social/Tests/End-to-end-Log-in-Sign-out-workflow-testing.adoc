== Conclusion

All core login and logout functions work correctly, with the majority of tests passing. Two issues were identified during testing. The first and most significant is that users do not receive an email notification when a new account is created or if the password is changed. This could be problematic, as users may not know for sure whether their account was created or if their password was changed. The second issue is that users can re-enter their old password when changing it. This poses a security risk, as users should be required to enter a different password. Aside from these two issues, the remaining tests were successful, and the core login and logout workflows function correctly.
