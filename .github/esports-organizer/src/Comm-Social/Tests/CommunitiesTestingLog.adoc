=== Testing Phase #2: Create Community UI

*Objective*: Verify and identify bugs related to the Create Community user interface.

The system correctly displays the Create Community UI form without any bugs. All elements are present and functional.

Important notes: Back-end integration for community creation is pending and will be tested in future phases. However, this is subject to time constraints.

=== Testing Phase #3: Join Event UI
*Objective*: Verify and identify bugs related to the Join Event user interface.

This feature is to be implemented in the future. No UI is currently available for testing. This is also tied to time constraints.
